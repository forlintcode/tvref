1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,320
-And the page is now live.
-Yes.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,840
Let the donations fa-low.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,280
[Hannah] Today is pyjama day.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,320
Seeing as though people love working from
home so much, I thought,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,720
oh, why don't we bring home
into the office.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,880
Roll out of bed, grab your
favourite thing.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,160
Rock up. Why not?

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,280
I brought two of my favourite movies.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,200
[in accent] My wife. She rather nice.
Borat two.

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,120
[screams]

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
But most importantly,
the Pyjama Day foundation is

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,640
Oh, such a great cause.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,840
-[notification bleeps]
-Yes.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,400
You are going to make
so much money for the office.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,480
For the office Pyjama day.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,200
Raising money
for the Pyjama Day foundation.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
Yeah.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,320
[Lizzie] We are using the donations
to hit our financial targets

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,720
so that we can keep the office open.

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,600
That was my idea.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,720
-[in Borat accent] High five.
-Yeah. [giggles]

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,120
-No, high five.

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,680
[in accent] My wife, she rather nice.

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,880
-My wife!
-No, don't.

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,120
[theme music plays]

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
[Lizzie] Okay. Let's see.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,960
Boyd signed in. Tina signed in.

28
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:44,160
Nick has not signed in,
so we shall assume he is absent today.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,479
Nick. Absent. Done.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,479
[laughs] What the hell?

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,840
Not the only one
that made an effort today.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,640
What is that?

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,040
-It's my pyjamas.
-That is my face.

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,680
I think it'd be a bit weird if I slept
in something with your face on it, Lizzie.

35
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,200
-[Lizzie] Not funny.
-[bird caws]

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,320
-Has your friend signed in yet?
-He is a visitor.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,720
Yeah, but shouldn't have
one of those visitor stickers?

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,079
-What's his name?
-My crows name is Russell.

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
-[Lizzie] What?
-Nothing.

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
That's a good name.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,440
-[Nick] Hello, Rusty. How are you, mate?
-Nick, no!

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,400
Russell is my roommate, my BFF,
and my an unemotional support animal.

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,840
He is extremely well trained.

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,120
[Deborah] No I'm looking for the accrued
expenses. Yeah. [coughs]

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,320
No, I'll just, sorry,
can you hang on for a minute?

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,800
-Will you fuck off with the sandalwood?
-I like sandalwood.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,280
[banging]

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Oi! You break it, you pay for it.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,440
[Deborah] Sorry about that.

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,840
Hannah wanted us to bring something fun
from home, so I brought my fun kids.

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,960
Deb looking toasty in the corner. Snuggy.

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,040
Tina. Sure.

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,800
We enjoying the work
from home at work vibes?

54
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,680
What,
what did you bring in from home, Greta?

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,720
-I brought in my book.
-[Hannah] Book nerd. [laughs]

56
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,120
Yeah, I read too. Love reading.
Bit of a reader.

57
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,360
Yep. Lloyd's peeking out of his Trackies,
which is… [groans]

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,520
Now everyone remember to send
out those donation links to your friends,

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,920
your families, your pimps.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,760
[Martin] We have a guest speaker coming in
today,

61
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,560
and I have told Hannah
about it multiple times,

62
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,680
and I will double
my donation if she has remembered it.

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,280
And no, I'm not wearing pyjamas because
I am an adult.

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,240
[Greta] Wow. Baking.

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,480
-How do you not have a girlfriend?
-Don't you have work to do?

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,640
Like a book to read?

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,920
-Okay.
-What's going on?

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,360
[camera clicks]
Pics for your new dating profile.

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,720
-Greta, no. No.
-Just act natural.

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,280
Natural?
What you surprise me with your camera?

71
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,279
-What am I supposed to be like?
-The exact opposite of what you're doing.

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,079
-I don't know how to…
-[Greta] Ahh, cute.

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,360
Looking forward to those biccies Nico.

74
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,240
Thanks, Lloyd. Yeah, me too.

75
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,800
Man. Should be good.

76
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,880
[coffee machine whirs]
And we won't be using that one.

77
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,840
Nope.

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
[Nick] Yeah. I'll bring dates home.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,200
It's great.

80
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,000
They walk through the lounge
and see my dad in his undies.

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,159
Then they see my mum in the kitchen
who asks

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,320
when they're going to make babies with me.

83
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,040
And that's usually when the date ends.

84
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,640
-Can I have my phone back, please?
-Don't you trust me?

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,840
No. Like, not at all.

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,520
Okay. Profile interests.

87
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,000
I dunno. Food.

88
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,240
Great. Foodie. What else?

89
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
That's it.

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
-You ever been to Paris?
-No.

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,160
But you surf, right?

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
You know I don't.

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
Okay, well, I'm going to make your profile

94
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
look like a guy
someone would actually want to date.

95
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,560
And I'm setting up a 5K radius
to keep it local.

96
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,600
Thank you.
[trumpet sound]

97
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,520
Slumber party meeting in the lounge room.
Last one in's a loser.

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,160
Yeah, I just I'm just kidding.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,360
Could everyone just come
into the meeting room, please?

100
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,680
-[Nick] Now?
-Yep.

101
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,640
Okay, just to let you know,
we have raised $280 so far,

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,800
but we're getting a lot of piddly $20, $30
donations.

103
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,040
So I emailed all the donors
saying that the amount is offensive

104
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,640
and it is time to step up their game.

105
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,320
Sure.

106
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,080
[Lizzie] I used to be in charge of troop
fundraising when I was in the Scouts,

107
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:47,120
and I have often found that a public
shaming is the most effective tactic.

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,800
[Hannah] Okay everyone, grab a bean bag.
Make yourself at home.

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,120
[Greta] Ah, interested now are we?
Any hotties?

110
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,080
So many Aperol Spritzes.

111
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,640
[Hannah] Now to get in the spirit of
pyjama day,

112
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,960
I thought we could kick things off,
a little bit of fun,

113
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,440
with a little game of [singing]
truth, dare, double dare,

114
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,280
-touch or kiss or promise?
-Dare.

115
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,840
Look, you're-- Not your turn Lizzie.

116
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,320
I dare someone to pass me the nuts.

117
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,600
I dare Nick to pat Russell.

118
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
I dare Lizzie
to use a toaster in the bath.

119
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,560
I don't eat toast, I eat jaffles.

120
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,040
[Hannah] Okay, okay.
All right, I'll start. Truth.

121
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,040
Ask me anything.

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,520
[Greta] Oh, is it true pyjama day is just
a sad attempt to make work more fun.

123
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,120
[lift dings]

124
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,640
Change it. Dare!

125
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,240
Who dares me to kiss Tina?
[laughs awkwardly]

126
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,960
All right, we'll get the fun
started with a pillow fight then.

127
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,120
-Ow!
-Come on. It's good fun.

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,640
[grunts and groans]

129
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,040
[Hannah] Martin!

130
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,800
Come on. Not now.

131
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,960
-I'm busy.
-Georgia's here.

132
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Who's Georgia?

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,840
Georgia is a workplace consultant
who will be leading a workshop

134
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
in workplace behaviour.

135
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,360
With a specific focus on,
boundaries and consent.

136
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,800
Look, I've got a jammy packed day.
Let's put a pin in this.

137
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,960
Reschedule. Circle back.

138
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,880
-Hannah, can I see you in my office?
-[Hannah groans]

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,840
-[Hannah] When?
Six months ago. A year ago?

140
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,200
-[Martin] Yesterday. The day before that.
-[Russell caws]

141
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,720
She has nothing to say that I couldn't say
in a way more fun way.

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,920
Look. Oh, no.

143
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,720
It's just that I, you know, like, today

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
is more being, like,
fun and loosey goosey, you know?

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,320
So what I'm thinking,
to start your presentation...

146
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,000
You're gonna start in the box. Yeah?

147
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
And then you're crouched in like this
and then start the music.

148
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,920
[Hannah sings] Dah dah!
-[Greta] What is she doing?

149
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
-[Hannah] …Hot in...
-No idea.

150
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,040
[Hannah singing] Dah dah! So hot in here!

151
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
[Nick] oh no, no, no.

152
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,159
-[Hannah] Ow!
-[Greta] What?

153
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,240
[Hannah] And then, I like, when you do it.

154
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Oh, no no no. [giggles]

155
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,600
-We've already matched.
-Oh, exciting.

156
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,240
The Pyjama Day Foundation is about raising
money for foster kids, not

157
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,920
it's not about being fun and hot and
loosey goosey.

158
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,400
Umm, I think it's about all of it.

159
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,600
-I might get started.
-[Martin] Sure.

160
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,760
Cool.

161
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,760
[Martin] All right. Hi, everyone.

162
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,800
This is Georgia.
She's a workplace consultant--

163
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,120
And she's going to get the party started.
She's got a 90 minute set.

164
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,560
Let's see if she can do a tight 30.

165
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,320
Oh, can we get this turned off, please?

166
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,360
Oh, no no, no,

167
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,800
This is the period blood dance bit!
Have you seen this?

168
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,200
-[Martin] No.
-It's hilarious.

169
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,720
Honestly. Look at it.
She's got blood dripping down her legs.

170
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
-Do we think this is appropriate?
-For a slumber party?

171
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,520
-Umm, Yeah.
-No, for the children.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
[Deborah] Hey, kids, grab some snacks.
Go and play hide and seek.

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,680
Yes, a nice one.

174
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,800
-[Martin] I'll just turn it off.
-Yeah, we can just Borat it up later!

175
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,560
Do you reckon she's seen my profile?

176
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,840
-100%.
-She's pretty cute.

177
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,760
[Georgia] The workplace has been going
through some significant changes

178
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,000
in the past few years.

179
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,280
No more printing.

180
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,160
-Still some printing. Yeah,
-Well, there's less printing.

181
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,880
I was talking about behavioural
changes and what is and isn't appropriate

182
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,080
in the workplace.

183
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,240
Drugs.

184
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,280
Unless they're prescription.
Deborah needs her xannies.

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,240
Isn't that right, Deb?

186
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
See, that's actually an example
of what isn't appropriate.

187
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,120
It's not our place to discuss
people's personal lives.

188
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
We'd need to discuss registered offenders.

189
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
She's got you there.

190
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,280
Could I get a volunteer, please?

191
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,400
Great. Thank you. Come on up.

192
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,680
-[Georgia] It's Nick, right?
-Yeah.

193
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,200
Great round of applause for Nick.

194
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
[polite applause]

195
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,360
Nick, could I get you to hold this
around your waist, please?

196
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,640
-Yeah, sure.
-So just holding that up

197
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,520
around your waist.
So this represents Nick's personal space.

198
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,680
Now, sometimes we have to remind ourselves
not to enter someone's personal space

199
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,520
without their consent first.

200
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,800
So we're going to do
a little role play now.

201
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,080
Hi, Nick. Happy birthday.

202
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,520
-May I give you a birthday hug?
-Yeah, totally.

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Okay, so only now can I enter
Nick's personal space to embrace him.

204
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,280
[Greta] Mason and I met pre Hinge,
pre Tinder, pre everything really.

205
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,160
We met in high school actually.

206
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,040
He came back to repeat his final year
and the rest is history.

Hey Lloyd mate. Yeah um...

210
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,200
You're kind of hanging loose.

211
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,880
Your whole...
We can see the whole barbecue mate. Yeah.

212
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,000
Have you got any other shorts
or pants or anything?

213
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,240
[Lloyd] Hang on, hang on.

214
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

215
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,480
Okay. Just easy, easy.

216
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,680
All right. Yeah, just.

217
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,880
-Ow.
-You okay?

218
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,720
Cool, good thanks. Thanks.

219
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,960
Biscotti?

220
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,320
Biscotti?

221

[Russell caws]

222
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,200
Dude, you're going to break people's
teeth?

223
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,200
Yeah but are they good, though?

224
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
-They're good.
-Really?

225
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
-They're delicious.
-Cool.

226
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,600
-How are you finding the workshop?
-It is interesting.

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
-Uh Huh.
-Mmm.

228
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,600
-Biscotti?
-Oh I...

229
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,640
Apparently, they're tough
and delicious, just like the baker.

230
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh, no. I'm fine.

231
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,160
I'm not really a biscuit person.

232
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,320
Ouch!

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,640
Hey, just a little bit of feedback
thus far.

234
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,200
I think you might be
losing the crowd a little bit.

235
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,320
Well, my job isn't really
to entertain the crowd.

236
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,840
Oh, no, obviously, that's my job.

237
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,880
[Georgia] We should probably
get back to it.

238
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,960
Yeah. Probably should.

239
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,320
[Hannah] Some people might feel threatened
by the new girl coming in,

240
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,880
get worried that
their staff will like her more,

241
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,120
and start
to overcompensate and fight for attention.

242
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Not me.

243
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm secure
knowing how my staff feel about me.

244
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,240
Don't even have to try.

245
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,920
[Georgia] Physical boundaries are
reasonably straightforward

246
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,120
and we'll just wait.

247
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,440
Oof!

248
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,520
Thank you Hannah.

249
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,240
But what about some other boundaries?
You may come in on a Monday morning,

250
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
someone might be telling you about
their weekend,

251
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,040
and it may be something
you don't want to hear.

252
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,000
[Deborah pretend coughs] Lloyd.

253
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,120
[Georgia] So I want you to find a partner,

254
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,080
and then I want you to practice
conversations

255
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,640
where you establish boundaries.

256
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
Ask each other a couple of questions,

257
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,480
but if at any point you don't feel
comfortable answering those questions,

258
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,360
just say, I'd rather not answer that.

259
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,920
-Okay, can I hear an okay?
-[all] Okay.

Can you ask me if I'm part
of the Mile High club?

00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
Okay. Are you part of the Mile High club?

266
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,840
Am I part of the Mile High club?

267
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,120
I don't know, You'll have
to ask the staff at Lufthansa Air.

I'd rather not answer that question.

number.

-Oh, buy me a drink first.

273
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,160
-For the exercise.
-Oh. Of course. Yeah.

274
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,000
[Georgia] Look, why don't we just take a
moment to acknowledge that we obviously

275
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,240
have connected online, but we'll just put
that aside for the workshop.

276
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,200
Yeah. On the...

277
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,160

-Okay, yeah.

Paris, you grew up in Paris.
What was that like?

279
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,840
I did grow there.
But I prefer not to answer that question.

280
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,560
-Oh, that's. Yep. That's fine. Umm...
-Yep.

281
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,640
I saw you like surfing.
Where do you like to surf?

282
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,400
Oh, I love to surf. I, er, I the, Bondi.

283
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
The Bondi.

284
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,200
-I'd rather not answer that question.
-Okay.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,560
-I like food.
-You like food?

286
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,040
Why don't we leave it there for a second?
So let's go back to our spots.

287
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,560
Okay, everyone. So that was great work.

288

Why don't we take this as a as a moment
to take a super quick

-[Nick] Greta, Greta, Greta.
No, no, no, no, no.

337
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,920
[Martin] Stay calm everyone.

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
So should I call the RSPCA
or the pest control?

339
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,240
[Lizzie] Come to me.
Come back in this room.

340
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,120
-[confused shouting]
-[Martin] Don't. Just.

341
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,080
Just don't stand on the chair.

342
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,720
-[Russell caws]
-[Lizzie] Russell! Come here.

343
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
Come, come.

344
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,280
Russell, come. Come.

345
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,560
Deborah! No!

346
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,200
[Lizzie] Deborah popped outside for a
smoke,

347
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,000
and Russell saw an opening and he took it.

348
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,599
I'm not concerned, though.

349
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,359
If there is one crow
that knows what it takes to survive

350
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,839
out there in the urban jungle.

351
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,599
It's Russell.

352
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,560
And Nick better watch out.

353
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,560
[Martin] So again, I'm just really sorry,
but, but anyway, thanks so much

354
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,720
for your patience today.

355
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,960
-I really appreciate it.
-Best of luck, Martin.

356
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,720
Hey, sorry about today.

357
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,640
-Umm, I just want to say goodbye.
-It's nice to meet you, Nick.

358
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,080
Maybe I'll catch you
around the Bondi sometime.

359
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,240
-Oh, no, I don't surf.
-No, I figured.

360
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,640
Oh, right.

361
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,840
Permission to give you an awkward hug.

362
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm going to exercise the right
to say no on that.

363
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,440
Yeah. Nice.

364
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,560
-So do you know how to use the--
-It's press the button.

365
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,160
Yeah. G,
because we're on one. So, yep.

366
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,760
That's how you that's
how you use the lift.

367
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,320
-[computer game noises]
-Hannah?

368
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,280
Oh, yeah. Martin.
Terrible timing. I've just…

369
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,040
-[keyboard clacks]
-Ping this.

370
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
-[Martin Clears throat] Lizzie.

371
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,880
Hannah, today was meant to be about
raising money

372
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,640
for the Pyjama Foundation.

373
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,440
Yeah, raising money for pyjama day.

374
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,840
Yeah, for foster children,
not the Flinley Craddick Foundation.

375
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Well,

376
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
if we don't meet our financial targets,
Martin,

377
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,880
we too will be foster children
lost to the system of remote work--

378
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,240
[Martin frustrated]
Donate the money to the foundation now,

379
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,520
and shut down the link.

380
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,640
$3,000! How did we do that?

381
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,360
Okay, I get it. I'll donate half now.

382
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,040
-All of it. Now.

383
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
And we will need to discuss
your behaviour today.

384
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,240
[in Borat accent] I like you.

385
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,560
[Hannah] I think we all learned something
today,

386
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,440
both about ourselves and each other.

387
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,840
When people are at home,
they're at their worst.

388
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Surrounded by sick kids,

389
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,840
predatory birds, everyone walking around
with their wangs hanging out.

390
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,200
But the workplace is somewhere we can go.

391
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,720
And for eight hours,
pretend we aren't those awful people.

392
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
You wanna walk down with me?

393
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,480
Oh, Mason's picking me up.

394
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,360
I thought you liked catching the bus,
people watching and that.

395
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
Yeah, I do like that.

396
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,120
But he's on a job in Parramatta this week
and thinks we should save the bus fare.

397
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,080
What, $4.28?
[chuckles]

398
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,320
-Oh, Lizzy asked me to give you this.
-Oh, wow.

399
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,680
-Are you scared?
-I'm so scared.

400
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I'll see you later.

401
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,640
Hey, I'm sorry about
the whole Georgia thing.

402
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,600
Oh, no. Whatever.

403
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,400
I was never going to work.
You know, she's not a, biscuit person, so.

404
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,160
You are so shallow.

405
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,160
Yeah, if you can add that to my profile
before surfer, I'd appreciate that.

406
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,840
Au revoir!

407
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
-[Crow caws]
-[Nick] Fu--

408
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
[sighs heavily]
