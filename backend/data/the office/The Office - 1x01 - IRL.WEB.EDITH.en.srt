1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,320
You know, sometimes I wake up
in the morning and I'm just like,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,960
bleurgh! I don't want to go to work today.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,960
And then I remember these guys.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,960
Get excited.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,280
Get that tingly feeling in my chest like,
ooh.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,240
I think it's safe to say
that we all feel that.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,240
Morning team.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,560
That's good.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,800
They're busy.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,280
-Morning Lizzie.
-Ah!

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,080
Alisha just called to say that she's
running ten minutes late.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,640
-For...?
-Your 10 a.m. meeting.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,560
Which will now be at 10:10.

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,360
How many people
do we have signed in today?

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,640
Four. Johann's in the toilet.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
The rest are working from home.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,640
Johnny, how many guys
are on the floor today?

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,560
[indistinct chatter]

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,800
[Hannah] Come in.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,320
Sorry, mate.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,880
Just firing off a big report.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,400
[Hannah chuckles] And sent.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,840
What can I do you for?

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
As you know, Hannah, we've been looking
at attendance across the branches.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,600
Well, you certainly don't need
to worry about numbers here.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,520
-So, Johnny from the warehouse?
-No, What?

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,720
Umm, ah, you know what?

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,080
I can see the resemblance,
but no, that's not him.

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,200
You were saying?

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, we've reviewed our flexible work
practices,

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,039
and given the low attendance rates,

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,320
Flinley Craddick can no longer
justify the cost of our office spaces.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
[Hannah] Yeah,

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,560
We're going to close the regional
branches and everyone will go remote.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,120
-What?
-Well, the warehouse will still stay open.

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,400
Everyone else will work from home.

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,560
[gulps]

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,440
I think that's a bad idea.

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
[blinds banging]

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,520
-[anxiously]
-So what are we talking?

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Home detention, house arrest?

42
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,280
What are we--
What are we talking here Alisha?

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
[Alisha] Please calm down. Hannah.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,200
Those people out there
are like family to me.

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,120
And I won't let you throw
them out on the street.

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,680
No one is going out on the street, Hannah.
They're just going home.

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,920
Do you think we can run Australia's
fourth largest packaging company

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
from the isolation of our own homes?

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
We can't.

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,880
Your lease expires
at the end of next month so--

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,800
What if we bring everyone in full time?

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,079
That'll boost productivity, right?

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,079
If we bring everyone in, I guarantee we
can make a year's worth of rent

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,960
by the end of next month.

55
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,640
-$300,000.
-300,000?

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,320
Yes. Too easy.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,960
How are you even going to convince
your staff to come in full time?

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
I won't need to convince them.
I'll just ask them.

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Please, Alisha.

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,680
Please, please, please.

61
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,760
-Fine. I'll talk to the board.
-Yes!

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,760
Yes!

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,760
But if any of your staff members
complain about being forced

64
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,320
to come in full time,
you are not to blame it on head office.

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Why would I do that? [scoffs]

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,920
Won't even mention your name.

67
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,120
[phones ringing]

68
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
That is Johnny from the warehouse.

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,600
What? Johnny, shame on you.

70
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,360
If there's anyone here
that doesn't actually work up here,

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
can you please leave?

72
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,680
Thank you.

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,680
[Hannah] Honestly, I don't know
what's gotten into you guys.

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,320
Not cool.

75
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,079
[theme music playing]

76
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,600
[car alarm bleeps]

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,440
[Hannah] Welcome, welcome.
Come on in. Pile in.

78
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,320
Yeah. Oh, there he is, Marty HR. Look out!

79
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,320
So exciting to see everyone
in the building all at once.

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,440
Yeah.

81
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,079
Great. Is that everyone?

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,960
We're one short. Do you want to wait?

83
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,200
Who is it? Lloyd?

84
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,360
Nah.

85
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,800
Firstly, may I say thank you very much
for coming in at such short notice,

86
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,040
and what an absolute pleasure it is
to look out and see

87
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
a room full of smiling faces.

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
Secondly, for those of you who haven't
met Sebastian, this is Sebastian.

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,640
Come on up.

90
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,079
Come on. Yeah.

91
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Sebastian started with us last week
on a three month unpaid internship on loan

92
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,880
from McClay Business College.

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,960
And I think I speak for everyone
when I say it's nice to have

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,360
some new blood in the office.

95
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,480
[laughs awkwardly]

96
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,840
Some fresh blood.

97
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,560
[hisses]

98
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,240
[Nick] I started as an intern.
I was Sebastian.

99
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,080
She's been doing that vampire shtick
for over seven years.

100
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,240
[in vampire accent]
I want to suck your blood.

101
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,840
[awkward laugh]

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,280
-Can I sit… down Thanks.
-Yeah. Yeah. By all means.

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
[Hannah] And thirdly, the big news.

104
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
-Oh.
-Oh.

105
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,520
Er, It's a lockout, Lloyd.
As specified on the phone call.

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,560
-Yeah, I get that.
-[Hannah] Yeah, just let him in.

107
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,560
-But it's a lockout.
-Yeah, just let him in.

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,160
Yeah, we can wait.

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,640
-G'day.
-Hi.

110
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,840
Sorry... just
had to drive in from Woy Woy.

111
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,520
-So, yeah.
-[Hannah] Yep. Lovely.

112
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,920
-So the big news.
-[Nick] Oh, don't tell us the quiz is off.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,560
-Oh, no.
-No, Nick, the quiz is not off.

114
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,280
[Hannah] The good news is...

115
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,200
As of today, we are all back
in the office full time.

116
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,200
[Lizzie] Yes!

117
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,480
[Greta] Wait. What?

118
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,560
[Lloyd] That's not good news.

119
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,520
No, I know.
This isn't the good news.

120
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,800
This is the bad news
that I forgot to tell you earlier.

121
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,480
The bad news. And get this.

122
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,640
Alisha comes in this morning

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,800
and tells me that head office are forcing
us to come back to the office full time,

124
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,040
effective immediately.

125
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,760
[disgruntled mumbling]

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,360
[Hannah] I know.
And she set new productivity targets.

127
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,680
$300,000 by the end of next month.

128
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
[Deborah] What?

129
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,840
And I tried to talk her back around but...
do you know what, though?

130
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,680
At least we've got each other
and a fully stocked fridge.

131
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,560
[Lizzie] Oh, no. The card declined
and so the order--

132
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,680
[Hannah] It will be stocked.

133
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,000
So, wait, what? What was the good news?

134
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,800
The good news is that now we can do

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,760
TGI Friday trivia quiz IRL.

136
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,040
What's IRL?

137
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,320
This is IRL. In Real Life.

138
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,600
[Hannah] As much as everyone loves being
here at work,

139
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,520
the reality is, [chuckles ] we have lives.

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,480
You know, people have homes and pets
and children and partners

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,120
that we'd rather be spending time with.

142
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,480
So yeah, it's frustrating.

143
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,000
And also even people that don't have some
or any of those things

144
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,920
because they've
sacrificed all of it for their career,

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,920
It is still frustrating.

146
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560
I imagine.

147
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
...220 by 320 but for your product,

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
I think our bubble pouches would
offer more protection and that's--.

149
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
[loud space invaders noises]
[Nick] Sorry. What was that?

150
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
[noises continue]
Yeah. Could you just give me one second?

151
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Sorry. Thank you.

152
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,840
-[alarm noises]
-Hey, what's going on with all this?

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,320
I am trying to find a distinctive chime
for this week's quiz.

154
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,320
-[noises]
-Yeah, cool.

155
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,520
I'm just trying to do my job
and close the sale.

156
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,120
That sounds like a Nick problem
and not a Lizzie problem.

157
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,280
Couldn't just put some headphones in.

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,640
No, Nick, I couldn't, because how could
I concentrate with that [loud noise]

159
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,800
-in my ear?
-Yeah.

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,240
How could you concentrate
with that in your ear?

161
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,040
-[klaxon sounds]
-I hate how you make me do this.

162
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,120
[Lizzie] Nick,
give me back my Tassie devil.

163
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,120
I'll give your devil back when you
stop making those annoying noises.

164
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,720
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

165
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
[Lizzie] Nick is a joke.

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,960
He is a mess around clown.

167
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,920
Sorry about that.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,480
So, as I was saying, the bubble pouches.
Hello?

169
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Hello?

170
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,400
[Greta] The perks of coming to work?
Riling up Lizzie.

171
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,240
Watching Nick rile up Lizzie.

172
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,280
Flirting. Who doesn't flirt at work?

173
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
And sales.

174
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,600
Obviously very,
very passionate about sales.

175
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,040
[coffee machine steams]

176
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,480
[Hannah] Whoa, whoa.

177
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,480
This one--Whoa. [laughs]

178
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,720
Hola. Como estas?

179
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,880
[knocking]

180
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,400
-Yep.
-You want to see me?

181
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
[whispers] Close the door.

182
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,320
I'm promoting you to Productivity Manager.

183
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,080
You're in charge of making that 300K
and I'm in charge of staff morale.

184
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,560
Sort of like good cop, bad cop.

185
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Yeah, yeah. Which one am I?

186
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,120
-Bad cop. Yeah.
-Bad cop.

187
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,400
-I need you to ride that sales team.
-Oh. Giddy up.

188
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
Can I expect a raise?

189
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,600
-[electronic voice] No, no, no.
-No...

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,800
But I do want you to come and see this.

191
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
-[Lizzie] Oh!
-[both laugh]

192
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
-I'm on the toilet.
-That's very clever.

193
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
[Hannah] Yeah, that's very clever.
[straining noise]

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,800
There's not enough fibre in my diet.
Oh, yeah.

195
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,200
Hey, don't get a haemorrhoid.
Don't get a haemorrhoid.

196
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,200
All right, that's that's…

197
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
300K. Make it happen. Yeah?

198
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,680
Yes, sir.

199
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,640
Please don't call me that.

200
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,120
She / Her, you know.

201
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,320
[Lizzie] I'm going to need you
to relinquish your chair please.

202
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
[Lizzie] I love a challenge.

203
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,880
Being challenged makes me feel alive.

204
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,600
Like I've got something to fight for.

205
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? Hey.

206
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,640
Oh. I am increasing productivity
in the workplace.

207
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,600
-By taking away my chair.
-By introducing standing desks.

208
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
Do you know about this?

209
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
[Lizzie] Sitting is the new smoking Nick.

210
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,680
-I thought vaping was the new smoking.
-Five.

211
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,480
Four. Three. Two--

212
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
I have a question.
When are the standing desks arriving?

213
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,440
You will simply be standing
at your old desk, Greta.

214
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,960
[Greta] But they're the wrong height.

215
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,280
[Lizzie] If you have a problem with my
plan, take it to H.R..

216
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,480
[chair rattles]

217
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,440
[Nick] Can I get my jacket back.

218
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,480
You can collect it from lost property
at the end of the day.

219
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,760
My chair was cold anyway, so...

220
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,360
[frame rattles]

221
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,240
[Hannah] Okay, TGI Friday IRL.

222
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's just throw around some key
words, see what sticks. Yeah?

223
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,400
-Right.
-[Hannah] Like, er, togetherness...

224
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,760
and fun.

225
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,440
Family.

226
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,880
It's a pity we can't do a funnier
zoom background.

227
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I feel like that might have been and gone.

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,320
Fun doesn't date. Err...

229
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,680
You're young, you're hip.
What do you do to have fun?

230
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,160
Um. Well, I sometimes will, like, order
food.

231
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,360
Food? Put it up. What else?

232
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,880
I mean, I sometimes listen
to music, I guess.

233
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Get it up there.

234
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,240
Food, music. Love that.

235
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,880
-[office chatter]
-That's cool.

236
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,240
-[worker] Thanks very much.
-[Martin] No worries

237
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
[Lloyd] Hey.

238
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,000
Am I really contracted
to be here full time?

239
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,200
Um, yeah, If you signed your contract
more than three years ago, probably.

240
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,760
Is there some kind of travel subsidy
that I could get?

241
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,960
[Martin] Um, if you signed your contract
more than three years ago,

242
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
probably not.

243
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,440
Can I actually have my contract
printed out, please?

244
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,640
I would, but, the printer is down.

245
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,520
Might probably get on to that.

246
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,600
-Yeah, it's an error 65, I think, yeah.

247
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,440
It's a tricky one. 65.

248
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,400
[Lloyd] I am the head of IT.

249
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, it's a department of one.

250
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm it.

251
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,040
[clears throat] It, I.T. [chuckles]

252
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,240
[indistinct chatter]

253
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,240
[paper rubbish rustles]

254
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,680
[Greta sighs] Oh my God. Hey!

255
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,880
-Check this out.
-What?

256
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,280
[Greta] Looks like someone
selling office chairs today.

257
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
-[Nick] Oh, my God, that's my chair.
-[Greta] Mm-hmm.

258
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,600
[Nick] Why has she called herself
Dirty Diana?

259
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,080
I think it's time to ask Dirty Diana
a couple of questions.

260
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,800
Ask her to take a photo.

261
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,040
No, no, no video.

262
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,720
-In the car park.
-[keyboard clacking]

263
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,640
[notification bleeps]

264
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,280
-[Nick] Yeah, yeah. So basically the…
-[Greta] Yeah.

265
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
[Nick and Greta mumble]

266
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,560
-Yeah. So the different size of the boxes.
-Okay. That's good.

267
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,040
[Zoom call rings]

268
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,520
[Man] Martin my man, are you all right?

269
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,520
-Hey.
-Looks like you're trying to take a shit.

270
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,960
Yeah. Sorry.

271
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,720
Yeah, there's something going on
with our chairs.

272
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,360
Look, I um,

273
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,560
I just wanted to touch base

274
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,640
and just see how you guys
were tracking up there in Brizzy.

275
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,280
Are you not at home?

276
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,440
No. We're still in the office.
Where are you?

277
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Did Alisha come in
and send all you guys home?

278
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
What?

279
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,840
Right. So I've been in touch with
Brisbane,

280
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,480
-Mm-hmm.
-and they have gone remote.

281
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,160
And Melbourne is following suit.

282
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,720
Interesting.

283
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,120
I'm assuming that Alisha
offered you the same opportunity.

284
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,680
If by opportunity you mean
a life sentence of home detention.

285
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,440
Solitary confinement. Sure.

286
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,720
So she did suggest that we
could go remote as well, right?

287
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,000
-Oh, I don't want to get
into semantics Martin.

288
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,640
Yeah, but that was an option?
That is a legitimate option?

289
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,360
What does semantics actually mean?
[mutters]

290
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm just going to have
a little look at the definition.

291
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,320
[keyboard clacking]

292
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,680
Right. So you'll need to tell the staff.

293
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,400
Okay.
So I'm just going to leave that with you.

294
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,760
[electronic voice] Yes.

295
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,400
[Greta] I noticed she didn't set
a reserve for the auction.

296
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,720
Oh, that's an oversight. [chuckles]

297
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,840
[Hannah] Hey, guys.

298
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,560
Um, Just a little heads up.

299
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,880
Meeting room, five minutes. Yeah?

300
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
[muffled phone conversations]

301
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,440
Five more minutes of this then.

302
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,520
Sorry I'm late,
I got caught up downstairs.

303
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,240
-Where are all the chairs?
-Downstairs.

304
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,280
I'm selling them.

305
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
-Who approved that?
-The Productivity Manager.

306
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
Who's the Productivity Manager?

307
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,800
-I am, you know, bad cop.
-Get the chairs back, Lizzy.

308
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,880
[Hannah] Um...

309
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,880
Right, about half an hour ago,
somebody who will remain nameless

310
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,280
walked into my office
and accused me of lying.

311
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,760
Wow. Am I a liar?

312
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Nope.

313
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,960
I'm a truth bender.
I'm a truth masseuse, if you will.

314
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,800
-What truth did you bend exactly?
-[Hannah] Nice, Greta.

315
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,120
Straight to the point. Love that.

316
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,400
So this morning, Alisha actually came in,
threatening to close down the office

317
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,680
and send you all home.

318
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,880
But, I... fought for your rights
and negotiated a deal

319
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,880
-in which we all get to stay.
-[all murmur]

320
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,080
-[Tina] Why didn't you tell us?
-Because I love you.

321
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,760
And I was protecting you.

322
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,680
[Lloyd] From who?

323
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,680
[Hannah] From yourselves.

324
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,280
You know, some of you might be thinking,
"Oh, yeah, I'd love to be at home".

325
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
You wouldn't. You'd hate it.

326
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,320
Deborah would self-harm
if she was stuck at home with the kids.

327
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,440
Isn't that right, Deborah?

328
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Could do. Yeah.

329
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,480
And look at what's happened to Lloyd
since he's moved to Woy Woy.

330
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,920
[Martin] So, to be clear, you're the one
making attendance mandatory.

331
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,680
[Hannah] Your words, not mine.
Yeah, that attendance is mandatory.

332
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,920
[all grumble]

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,960
[Greta] And if we don't make the money,
we all go remote?

334
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,800
[Hannah] Defeatist attitude Greta.

335
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,160
But yes. That's correct.

336
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,640
-Come on.
-Crazy idea.

337
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,160
Should we just skip to the bit where we
fail and we can all just go home now?

338
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,720
I don't think anyone
really wants that. Do you?

339
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,520
[Nick] I am definitely a homebody.
I love cooking, I love gardening,

340
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,200
but I wouldn't want to commit
to never coming into the office.

341
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,720
There are things that I'd definitely miss.

342
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,120
[Greta] Well, it's complicated because
working from home makes a lot of sense.

343
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,160
More flexibility, more time to watch
YouTube videos of baby pygmy hippos.

344
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,520
But by going to the office,
there are things to look forward to.

345
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,480
You have that feeling of like,
yeah, I get to see everyone today.

346
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,840
[Lizzie groans]

347
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,240
[indistinct phone chatter]

348
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,040
Hey, Lizzie. What's up?

349
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,440
-You wouldn't get it.
-Try me.

350
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,440
I need to buy the chairs back but
I've just sold them to some clown for $3.

351
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
Oh, yeah, that was Nick.

352
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,640
[Lizzie] Nick!

353
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,000
I need to buy them back.

354
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,960
[Nick] Tell you what.

355
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,319
I'll sell them back to you for four bucks.
But under one condition.

356
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,680
What's the condition?

357
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,200
I get to be quizmaster.

358
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,480
[Lizzie huffs]

359
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,120
[hisses venomously]

360
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,560
-[hisses]
-[Greta] Oh, gosh.

361
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,480
[road noise]

362
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,600
[Stevie] Yeah, I don't know the ins and
outs of it, but I heard the guys upstairs

363
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,080
-are going home.
-[thud]

364
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,760
Wouldn't be devastating for us.

365
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,800
[lift dings]

366
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,840
[upbeat music on radio playing]

367
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,960
[Hannah] Coming back full time
might not appeal to everyone at first.

368
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,640
It's like they've been invited to a party
they don't want to go to,

369
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,760
but then they get there and they're like,
"I'm having the best time".

370
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,400
"Thank God Hannah made me come
to this party".

371
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,960
[jovial chatter]

372
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,680
Okay, let's put them in the circle
so they can all see each other.

373
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,960
[upbeat music playing]

374
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,720
-Hey, Deb! Quiz is about to start.
-I'll zoom in.

375
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,080
[mumbles] But it's IRL.

376
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,400
I'll be IRL, right out there.

377
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,720
Great. Well, see you on the zoom.

378
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,880
But I thought we could do it all
together like a family, you know?

379
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,080
-Like all together.
-Yeah.

380
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,840
Traffic's building up on the M1, so.
But I'm keen to zoom.

381
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,080
Oh. Okay.

382
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,520
[in Italian accent]
But it's a pizza party.

383
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,640
Come on. All the pizza.

384
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,400
Want a pizza?

385
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I guess the advantage of zoom is
that you can still run your

386
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
funniest zoom background competition.

387
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,200
That is true.

388
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,760
[zoom feedback echoes]

389
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,080
Can everyone please mute themselves? Yes.

390
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,120
[feedback continues]
Everybody on mute now. Thank you.

391
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,720
[feedback stops]

392
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,560
Now, this week, I have decided
to let Nick have a go at being quizmaster.

393
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,320
So now I'm going to make him the host.

394
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,600
And I absolve all
responsibility forthwith.

395
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,200
Thank you. Lizzie.

396
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Good luck everyone.

397
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,560
To help our company's bottom line,

398
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,960
How much did Lizzie sell
all our office chairs for?

399
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,640
A, $3, B, $30, C, $300, or D, $3,000?

400
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,320
-Clock's ticking.
-[buzzer noise]

401
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,280
[bright noise]
Oh, well done, Greta.

402
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,640
Thank you Quizmaster.

403
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Which member of the office
goes by the online alias Dirty Diana?

404
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Nick. They need to be questions
that everyone knows the answers to.

405
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,960
That wouldn't be a quiz.

406
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,880
-[Lizzie] You know what I'm talking
about, Nick.

407
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,840
-[quiz buzzers ding]
-Hey, baby girl.

408
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,720
Mason. Hey.

409
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,200
-I thought you were coming at five.
-I finished early.

410
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,880
[buzzers continue]

411
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,320
Okay. What best describes the new smoking?

412
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,720
Is it A, sitting or B, vaping?

413
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,960
-[Hannah making dance music sounds]
-Sorry, Nick, can you repeat the question?

414
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,200
It's just a bit loud in here.

415
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,960
-[Hannah laughs]
-[buzzers ding]

416
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,840
[singing badly]

417
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,440
[Hannah] What matters to me the most?
Is it the money?

418
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,960
Nope. Is it the power?

419
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,960
Nope. Most important?

420
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
The people.

421
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,720
I love my staff.
And I told them that today.

422
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,280
And to see their faces. "Hannah loves me".

423
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,400
And then to hear them say,
"We love you, Hannah".

424
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,560
Not with words, but…

425
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,040
Wow.
