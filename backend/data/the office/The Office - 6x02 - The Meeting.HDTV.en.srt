1
00:00:01,016 --> 00:00:03,000
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Oscar, come right in...

2
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:06,000
Close the door, if you would.

3
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:07,950
Thanks so much for talking to me.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,527
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:11,458
I'm going in for a procedure today.

6
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:13,288
Is everything okay?

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,041
It's routine.
I'm just a little bit scared.

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,958
I'm sure everything will be fine.

9
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:21,091
What's the procedure,
if you don't mind my asking?

10
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:23,191
It is a colonoscopy.

11
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:28,472
In your experience,
what should I be expecting...

12
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:30,867
...in terms of sensation...

13
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,947
...or emotions?

14
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:42,409
Is there anything

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,638
I can do to make it more pleasurable...

16
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:47,203
...for me or for Dr. Chaudry?

17
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:53,622
My main concern is
should I have a safe word?

18
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,477
You think you can get me a rundown
on the Buffalo clients by Monday?

19
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:20,454
You know what?
I'll do you one better.

20
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:22,090
Sunday, Sunday night.

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,945
Okay, I will get it Monday.

22
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:25,668
Hold on, big guy.

23
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:28,781
I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday.
You'll get it Wednesday.

24
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,035
Jim, you want to hit the conference room?

25
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:32,273
Good luck.

26
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,491
Right, this thing.
I remember now.

27
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:37,468
What's this about?
- This is me and David, if it's okay.

28
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,880
That's okay with me,
he's gonna want me in.

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,392
It's okay. We got it.

30
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:43,492
Really?

31
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,322
Do you mind if I sit this out?

32
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:49,587
I have so much work,
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

33
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:02,696
Am I worried that Jim and David
are having a meeting without me?

34
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:05,629
Because we are the Three Amigos.

35
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:09,991
And once in a while,
one of the amigos will go off...

36
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:15,191
...to the bathroom while the other two
have a secret meeting.

37
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:22,570
Let me escort you to your desk.

38
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,712
It's just...

39
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:25,630
...three or four steps, but thank you.

40
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,759
You and Jim are close, huh?

41
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:31,939
I think the pregnancy
really brought us together.

42
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,000
What do you think
he and David are talking about?

43
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,101
I don't know.
- You said good luck to Jim.

44
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:39,959
Did I?

45
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:44,224
Doesn't sound like me.
I'm not very superstitious.

46
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,586
If you're lying to me right now,

47
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,729
your baby is gonna come out a liar.

48
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:55,909
That's how it works.

49
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,774
They inherit things
through the breast milk.

50
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:00,864
Please don't talk about my breast milk.

51
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:03,577
I just don't want you to lie to me.

52
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:07,671
I don't want you to ever lie to me.
Have I ever lied to you?

53
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,423
I just don't want you to.

54
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,327
I was rushing to fill an order.

55
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:14,583
I put the ladder up to grab
a box of three-hole from the top shelf.

56
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:17,383
Next thing I know, I'm on the ground,
ladder's on top of me.

57
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:20,543
And that's how you broke your ankle?

58
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:21,951
Interesting.

59
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:24,508
How did the ladder end up on top of you...

60
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,081
...if you fell off of it?

61
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:28,444
This doesn't concern you.
You need to walk away.

62
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,775
Really? I'm sorry.
I thought this was a free country.

63
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,905
I didn't know
we were in communist Sweden.

64
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:38,882
If we were, I wouldn't have to worry,
'cause we'd have universal health care.

65
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:41,107
Be quiet.
- I'm talking...

66
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,980
I will send this off to corporate,
hold on to your medical bills.

67
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,272
Feel better.

68
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,961
Thanks, T-man.

69
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,061
Later.

70
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:51,757
So long, Darryl.

71
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,242
Feel better.

72
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:54,968
He's lying.

73
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,637
He has a doctor's note.

74
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,507
From who, Dr. J?

75
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,469
You really need to investigate this.

76
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,684
People don't just fall off of ladders.

77
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,687
Guy on my street fell off
painting his house. It was on the news.

78
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,357
Since when have you known Darryl
to rush to do anything...

79
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,865
...other than to come up here
for birthday cake?

80
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:13,178
'Y'all having birthday cake?'

81
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:15,197
That's not a very good Darryl.

82
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,037
How many foremen do you know
that pull boxes?

83
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,591
It just doesn't add up.

84
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:27,278
We did a little investigation,
and Dwight had a good point.

85
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:29,183
The ladder didn't reach the top shelf.

86
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:31,505
I don't know if I believe it, but...

87
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,119
I am a fan
of the hardboiled detective novel.

88
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,939
'I'll punch you into mush, see?'

89
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,296
Well, if he doesn't like it,
you can tell that S.O.B.

90
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:43,319
that he is fired.
Sorry, I'm going into a meeting.

91
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,817
I will... I love you too. Bye.

92
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,696
Who was that?
- Sorry about that. What'd I miss?

93
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:51,316
We would like to continue
this meeting in private,

94
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,675
please, if you don't mind.
- I do not mind.

95
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,539
Yes, I do. No, I don't.
Yes, I do.

96
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,780
No, I don't.
Catch you on the flippity-flop.

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,080
This...

98
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,180
...call waiting.

99
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,837
You tell the mayor
he just lost six votes.

100
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:07,736
They've been in there a while.

101
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,872
Can't be good.

102
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,718
Think they're talking about me?

103
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:15,193
No, I think they're talking about me.

104
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,391
That makes way more sense.

105
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,358
Okay, thanks, boss.

106
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,297
What is Jim telling him?
That I can't handle this job?

107
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:24,397
That is bull crap.

108
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,691
Although it has been chaotic lately.

109
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,670
Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch,

110
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,942
which left us
to absorb all of their clients.

111
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,595
I will tell you, there has been work...

112
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:36,942
...every day.

113
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,677
Had to come in on a Saturday...

114
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,526
...to retrieve...

115
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,836
I left my cell phone here.

116
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,080
So jealous of your boobs.

117
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,489
I just wanted to confirm
that you're not coming to the wedding,

118
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,002
which is totally understandable,
and more than fine.

119
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:00,319
Is Ryan going?

120
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,280
I don't know, he hasn't RSVPed yet.

121
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,787
We invited everyone in the office
to our wedding,

122
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,877
even though we realized most people
wouldn't be able to make the drive...

123
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:09,977
...to Niagara Falls.

124
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:14,042
Which is why we're having it
in Niagara Falls.

125
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,247
Then Michael...

126
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:17,694
...told everyone they could have
Friday and Monday off...

127
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,350
...if they came.

128
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,362
So now people have to decide
if they want to come to our wedding...

129
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,462
...or have to work.

130
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,597
Here's the deal.
I really want to go.

131
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:31,583
But I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go,
because it's kind of a waste of time.

132
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,834
That came out wrong.

133
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:39,139
It'd be awesome if you get him to go,
I'd really like to be there for Jim.

134
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,614
What can I do for you, hoss?

135
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,670
How are your sales doing?
- How are my sales doing?

136
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,770
Busted.

137
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:53,670
My numbers are down.
A little bit.

138
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,065
It's 'cause of the economy.

139
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:59,792
You're not buying it.
You're good.

140
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,842
Okay, the truth is...

141
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:04,804
I have been having trouble
focusing lately. I'm in this weird,

142
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:05,961
flirty,

143
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,204
nebulous...

144
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:08,102
...thing...

145
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:10,353
...with this cousin of mine.

146
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,457
And it's a total mind f'er.

147
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,014
Again with the cousin.

148
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:15,708
I'm sorry, Phyllis.

149
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:17,665
You explain this email, okay?

150
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:19,859
'Hey, Andy, let's go visit grandma...

151
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,509
'and then get drunk together.'

152
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,681
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on in that room.

153
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,614
Wallace had to show up...

154
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:32,936
...on the one four-month period
that I'm completely overwhelmed.

155
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:37,052
You know when they say
it's so crazy it just might work?

156
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:40,789
I don't believe that.
I say go for the airtight plan.

157
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,947
And that is why I am having Andy...

158
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,901
...wheel me into the conference room
inside a makeshift cheese cart.

159
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,906
It is...

160
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:50,006
...just...

161
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:52,064
...elegant.

162
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,571
Be my eyes.
- You got it.

163
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:57,671
What have we here?

164
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,371
Just backing up and turning around.

165
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,798
We're gonna do this...

166
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,898
That's not for you.

167
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:06,511
Pardonnez-moi, monsieur.

168
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:09,147
I took the liberty of preparing for you...

169
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,330
...a cheese platter, which I will...

170
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,394
...place here on the eastern wall
of the conference room.

171
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,771
Cheese platter?
- Oui, oui, monsieur.

172
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,866
From the Wisconsin region,
a nice, firm cheddar.

173
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:23,057
Also from the great city of Wisconsin,

174
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:25,157
an aged parmesan.

175
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:28,062
Here you will find
a cheddar-style spread,

176
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,952
which has reacted nicely with the air...

177
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,238
...to form a light rind,

178
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:34,963
which I think you'll find
both challenging and delicious.

179
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:37,375
At that point,
I would recommend you take...

180
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,962
...a quick trip south of the border
to the great state of Illinois,

181
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,045
where you will find
this fine blue cheese dressing.

182
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,858
If I may be so bold,

183
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,115
it's a lot of fun...

184
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,803
...to let the goldfish...

185
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,532
...take a little swim in the blue cheese.

186
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:52,632
Bon appétit.

187
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,921
I should go.

188
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:58,772
Thanks for this.
You've given me a lot to think about.

189
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,287
Promise me you won't do anything
until we speak.

190
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:03,387
I won't.

191
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:09,331
Thanks for taking the time.
- Appreciate it. Thank you, Jim.

192
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:18,268
Erin, is Michael around?
- I think... he's around here.

193
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,556
You must have walked right past me.
How you doing?

194
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:27,651
Could we talk in your office?
- Yes, definitely.

195
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,992
It sounds like a...

196
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,169
EMD P40.

197
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,263
That's a GE.

198
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:45,068
The P40 is much higher pitched.

199
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,093
You're into trains?
- I've been my whole life.

200
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:52,363
I'm rebuilding a turn-of-the-century
steam engine in my slaughterhouse.

201
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:54,214
That's so cool.

202
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:55,929
I'd love to take a look.

203
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,561
It's just a slaughterhouse,
but, sure, any time.

204
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:01,108
You know, 'cause of the trains.

205
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,836
Someone's coming.
- Boy.

206
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,630
It's Darryl! Get down!
He's not using crutches!

207
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,340
Get the camera. Start taping.

208
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,248
Drive!
- Worker's comp my ass!

209
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:12,258
I can't believe this.

210
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:14,139
You asshole!

211
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,724
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?

212
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:24,182
Man! You OK?

213
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:33,573
I just wanted to confirm
that you're not coming to my wedding.

214
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:35,673
Yeah, I might stop by.

215
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:38,330
It costs about $75 per person.

216
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,499
I once had a glass of cognac
that cost $77, so...

217
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,679
Can you just tell me now
if you're coming or not?

218
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,437
I'm coming.

219
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,350
Ryan Howard yes?
- Probably yes.

220
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,450
Kelly Kapoor yes.

221
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:56,627
Are you sure you're okay
with these new responsibilities?

222
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,207
Look who you're talking to.
- Just trying to figure out...

223
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:02,103
...the best way
to utilize everyone's talents.

224
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,974
I would say that my greatest talent...

225
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:07,418
...is being the best man,
woman or child...

226
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:10,176
...to have ever run this branch.
- And what about Jim?

227
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:15,121
You think Jim is ready to move
into a management position?

228
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,666
Permission to speak on the record.
- Please, do.

229
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,593
Jim is like...

230
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:25,853
Big Bird.

231
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,603
He is tall...

232
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:28,790
...and yellow...

233
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,115
...and very nice.

234
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:33,020
But when I put him in charge, no.

235
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,158
I don't think so.

236
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:38,363
Big Bird doesn't make
the tough decisions.

237
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,600
If I was going to put someone in charge,

238
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,524
I would put Bert in charge.

239
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:45,522
Or I would put
one of the real grown-ups, like Maria.

240
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,441
Or Gordon, maybe.
- I thought you liked Jim.

241
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,490
Very much.
Jim is my best friend.

242
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,403
But...

243
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,053
Here's his performance report.

244
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,868
Right here.

245
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,518
Now, this was written by Toby.

246
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:02,355
Who we all know is extremely...

247
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,706
...reliable.

248
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,642
'Constant office distraction.

249
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:07,794
'Spends way too much time at reception.

250
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,857
'Antagonizes other salesmen.
Not at all what he thinks he is.'

251
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:14,008
It's not very well written.
But you get the gist.

252
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,455
Is there anybody else
could run the day-to-day of the branch?

253
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:19,690
I could continue to run it myself,
that's...

254
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,474
Jim had an interesting idea...

255
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,560
...to help you with this extra workload.

256
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,347
And it involved
you being promoted to oversee.

257
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:28,084
All Northeast sales.

258
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:32,179
And then Jim would be promoted
to your position.

259
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,842
This was Jim's idea?

260
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:44,238
I'd have to talk to my mother...

261
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,816
...and my guy at H&R block.

262
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,417
Here's the thing, though.
The plan doesn't work...

263
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:57,552
...unless we have someone to replace you.
I was hoping...

264
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,526
Plus, we have to worry about Jim.
He has another job offer.

265
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,921
We may have to replace him.

266
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,198
I didn't tell Michael because...

267
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:07,593
I thought he'd try to help.

268
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,552
Example: he handed out jell-o shots...

269
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:13,477
...at the 23rd mile
of the Steamtown Marathon.

270
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:19,166
Can you walk me down to my car?
- Sure.

271
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:43,601
I can't help
but feel partially responsible.

272
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:53,180
Little pick-me-up.

273
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Those are the best.

274
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,195
Sugar rush.

275
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,520
When you were talking to Wallace,

276
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,620
did I come up at all?

277
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:04,981
We did talk about how handsome you are.

278
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:07,632
Why don't we head in your office?

279
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:09,259
What did we...

280
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,789
We said...

281
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:14,374
I know there were certain things we said.

282
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,043
I'll just be honest with you.
Earlier today,

283
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:18,956
I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.

284
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,541
And I actually think
that talk went really well.

285
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,135
Then after he spoke with you,

286
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:26,119
for some reason,
it felt like things had changed.

287
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,429
That's weird.
That's weird.

288
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,921
Kind of weirding me out.

289
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:34,772
Did you know that
Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy?

290
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,872
Did you say anything?

291
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:39,213
Tell you what,
when you leave this office,

292
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:43,205
I'm going to call Wallace and tell him
that you should get that promotion.

293
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:44,450
Really?

294
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,753
You will?

295
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,853
Wanna do it right now?

296
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,742
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.

297
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,990
I should have known that he can do...

298
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,382
...just as much damage in the dark.

299
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:02,732
I need to see your pupils.
See if they're dilating.

300
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,309
Is that them?

301
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,409
Definitely.

302
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:08,725
You come to my house,

303
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,437
bust up my trash cans,

304
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:13,396
Call my baby sister an asshole
and told her to eat dog food?

305
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,356
We thought that she was you.

306
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,261
Why would you think a lady is me?

307
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,996
Are you serious?

308
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:25,731
Because you look exactly alike.

309
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:28,874
Am I the only one?
Are you getting this?

310
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:31,792
I don't see it.
- Here's what I'm gonna do.

311
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:36,753
I'm calling corporate and I'm filing
a complaint against both of you.

312
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,853
Come on, Gwyneth.

313
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,245
Sad.

314
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,774
This is David.

315
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:46,283
David, this is Michael...

316
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:51,284
Just wanted to talk to you
about Jim Halpert.

317
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,864
I understand...

318
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:55,407
...that he did not receive that promotion.

319
00:15:55,507 --> 00:16:00,360
And I wanted to see what I could do
to nudge you in the right direction.

320
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,131
You're changing your mind about Jim?

321
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,606
Absolutely...

322
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:05,671
...not!

323
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,771
Like I said before,

324
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,537
Jim is fantastic,
and he deserves this job.

325
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,676
It seems like you're cutting in and out.

326
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,666
This is not what you said earlier.

327
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:20,326
Here's the thing.

328
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:23,479
Jim is the best man for this job.
I think you should give it to him.

329
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,829
It doesn't change
what you showed me in Jim's file.

330
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:30,957
That was an anomaly.

331
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:33,387
That file had been...

332
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:34,884
...falsified.

333
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:37,619
Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.

334
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:40,488
I really don't know
what's going on down there.

335
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:41,691
Damn it!

336
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:46,466
I'm getting pulled over
for talking on my cell. Damn it.

337
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:51,354
Darryl, look,

338
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:53,525
we're here to apologize.

339
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,914
We're cool.
- Wait.

340
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,777
They're using the lift
as their own personal elevator.

341
00:16:57,877 --> 00:17:00,049
He broke his ankle
climbing over the railing,

342
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,247
he lied about it 'cause it was a misuse...

343
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,774
...of company equipment.

344
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:06,775
Case closed.
- That's stupid.

345
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,724
Really?

346
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:11,734
Then why is there new wood
only on one railing?

347
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:15,104
Let's just check the security tapes.

348
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,650
I don't think there's any reason
to check 'em.

349
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,890
But I supposed
if you wanted to be really certain...

350
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,370
All right.
Fine, so whatever.

351
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,616
You really did it.

352
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:29,742
Now I would like
to file an official complaint...

353
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,850
...to corporate
because Darryl lied on an official form.

354
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,388
I'm telling them
you sexually harassed my sister.

355
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:39,953
No judges gonna believe that.

356
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,454
We could all file complaints
against each other,

357
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:49,444
and just drown in a sea of paperwork.
But,

358
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:51,658
we'll just move on with our...

359
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:53,758
...with our lives.

360
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,444
So Dwight and Darryl...

361
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:58,739
...came to an agreement
that they would both file...

362
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,489
...complaints with corporate,

363
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:03,904
and now I got to do all this paperwork.

364
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:06,482
We worked it out.

365
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:13,978
It would make me feel really good
if you would punch me in the face.

366
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:15,642
All right? Just do it.

367
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:18,748
How many times have I asked you
to put me up for a branch manager job?

368
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,740
I never recommended you
because I didn't want to lose you.

369
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,640
And I don't want to lose Pam.

370
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,421
Now I don't want to lose the baby.

371
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,133
Instead, you screwed me?

372
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,233
That's what she said.

373
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,597
David Wallace is calling.
- I'm in the middle of something.

374
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:37,433
Should I tell him you'll call back?
- I'll tell him myself.

375
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,533
Let's both.

376
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:48,444
You got Jim there with you?
- No, it's just us.

377
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,439
Can you call Jim in?
I want him on this.

378
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:52,422
Please.

379
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,522
Here he is right now.

380
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,181
Come in.

381
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,963
So I spoke to Alan.

382
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,291
We had kind of an unconventional idea,
which I think is pretty cool.

383
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,940
But it only works if everyone's on board.

384
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,647
Just as long as it means
Jim becomes a manager.

385
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:19,080
We were thinking of having
two branch managers in Scranton,

386
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,608
Both of you guys working as co-managers.

387
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,271
Jim would handle the day-to-day,

388
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,183
and, Michael, you would focus
on clients and big picture stuff.

389
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,016
That sounds pretty cool.
- I like that!

390
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:30,863
So manager and co-manager.

391
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,049
Co-manager and co-manager.

392
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:37,088
There are a lot of moving pieces,
and this is the only way I can sell it.

393
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:41,700
That might be a little confusing
because they know me as manager.

394
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,115
Michael,
can you pick up for one second?

395
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,565
Okay, look,
I'm not gonna force you into anything.

396
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,849
If you're willing to lose Jim, fine.

397
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:54,689
You just say so.
We'll find another solution.

398
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:57,226
Is that what you want to do?

399
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,365
OK, people, listen up!
- Everybody...

400
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,546
I have an announcement to make.
Fraud was committed...

401
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,960
You have an announcement?
- I was making it.

402
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,960
Everybody,
David Wallace and I've talked,

403
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,993
And we have decided to promote Jim
to the position of co-manager.

404
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,983
Co-manager of what?
- Of your butt!

405
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,349
And your butt, and your butt...

406
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:26,542
All of Scranton branch butts.

407
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,194
What's happening to you, Michael?
- What's happening to me?

408
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,698
I am also being promoted to co-manager.

409
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,518
We will be co-managers together.

410
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:39,265
Welcome.

411
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:50,378
Niagara falls in October?
Hells yeah!

412
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:53,767
Do you think that you could send in
your RSVP card?

413
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,148
I'll just tell you now.
Easier.

414
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:57,831
You've to choose a food option,

415
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:00,785
and there's information in there
about directions and lodging.

416
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,207
I'll just have whatever's fanciest,
unless there's ribs,

417
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,873
I'll get the other information
the day of. I'll text you.

418
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,648
You're going to text me...

419
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:10,671
...the morning of my wedding
to ask for directions?

420
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,016
And you will eat whatever is fanciest?

421
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:15,116
Unless there's ribs.

422
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,885
Rude.

423
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,650
So rude, right?

424
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,733
My gosh.

425
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,032
I have been chasing people down all day.

426
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:25,107
It's incredible.
- My bag was there.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
