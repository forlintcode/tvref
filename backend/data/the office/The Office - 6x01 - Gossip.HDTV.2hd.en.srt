1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,660
Parkour!

2
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:09,623
Parkour!

3
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:11,119
Parkour!

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,094
Extreme!
- Parkour!

5
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:15,330
This is parkour.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,611
Internet sensation of 2004.

7
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,442
And it was in one of the Bond films.

8
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,295
It's pretty impressive.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,235
The goal is to get from point A...

10
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:23,712
...to point B as creatively as possible.

11
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:25,996
So technically they are doing parkour...

12
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:27,386
...as long as point A is delusion...

13
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,121
...and point B is the hospital.

14
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:41,331
Okay, here we go!
- Andy, leapfrog!

15
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,431
Do me! Do me!

16
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:46,772
Get off! Get off!

17
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:52,082
Jump over it.
Jump over the camera.

18
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:54,182
Jump over the camera.

19
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,667
Okay, we all go together
or we go one at a time.

20
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:58,842
Here it is.

21
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:00,942
Truck to refrigerators,

22
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:02,409
to dumpster,

23
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:07,694
360 spin onto the pallets,
backflip gainer into the trash can.

24
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,457
Hardcore parkour!
- Hardcore parkour!

25
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:14,297
I'm right behind you! Come on!
- Let's do it!

26
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,603
Parkour.

27
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,641
Good.

28
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,879
Excellent.

29
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:49,932
Thank you.

30
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:53,772
Here you go.
Is there anything else I can do?

31
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:04,983
See those files behind Kevin's desk?

32
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,803
Go put them all in random order.

33
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:09,901
Then come back here
for your next assignment...

34
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,484
...concerning their order.

35
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,373
This is the last day
of our summer interns.

36
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:17,649
It's been nice.
We haven't had interns in a while...

37
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:20,384
...ever since Michael's
Monica Lewinsky incident.

38
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:22,292
He didn't do anything sexual.

39
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,433
He just made far, far too many

40
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:25,505
Monica Lewinsky jokes.

41
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:29,321
It was just easier for corporate...

42
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:31,178
...to shutdown the program.

43
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:33,421
Think she did him?
- There's something there.

44
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,987
I was in the kitchen yesterday...

45
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,447
...and they were too happy...

46
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:37,243
...to be cleaning the freezer.

47
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:39,030
If they get married before I do,

48
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:39,893
I'm gonna kill myself.

49
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,628
Who's getting married?
- Nobody.

50
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:44,898
I'm gonna start screaming.

51
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,379
Eric and Megan.

52
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,119
I hired them.

53
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,079
Matchmaker.

54
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:51,781
This place is like Spaniard fly.

55
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,907
They're not getting married.
It's just talk.

56
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,660
Everybody knows about this but me?

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,775
There's nothing to know.
It's gossip.

58
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:04,099
We haven't told anyone that I'm pregnant.

59
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,217
What with her being unmarried.

60
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:07,324
Knocked up by some guy.

61
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:09,105
The yakkity-yaks in this office...

62
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:09,818
...would have a field day.

63
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:11,142
We don't want them...

64
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:11,868
...at the wedding thinking...

65
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:14,682
...Jim's being marched down the aisle...

66
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:15,988
...by my dad with a shotgun.

67
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:18,444
Wait,
there's not gonna be a shotgun?

68
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:19,709
No shotgun?

69
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:23,415
'Cause that changes everything.
- Can't back out now, Halpert.

70
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:27,953
What are you gonna do about it?
There's no shotgun, so...

71
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:30,348
Free at last. Free at last.

72
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,409
No, keep it up.

73
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:35,861
You'll never guess what I know.

74
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:37,559
Let me finish this thought.

75
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,659
Eric likes Megan.

76
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,706
He most definitely does.

77
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,942
He's been asking her out for weeks.

78
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,042
She finally said yes.

79
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,502
They went out the other night.

80
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,978
Apparently it went very well.

81
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,209
How do you know this?
- People tell me things.

82
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:53,269
I guess I have a face you can trust.

83
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,073
I think
it's because of my low cheekbones.

84
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:57,740
And...

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,900
Okay, what is it?
What can't I guess?

86
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:03,816
I hate, hate, hate being left out.

87
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,620
Whether it's not being
picked for a team...

88
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,278
...or being picked for a team
and then showing up...

89
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:12,499
...and realizing that
the team doesn't exist...

90
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,214
...or that the sport doesn't exist.

91
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,864
I should have known. Poopball?

92
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:21,596
Man, I know how you feel.
Third wheel.

93
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:25,399
I have been the third wheel
so many times in my life.

94
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,751
My mom told me something once...

95
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,673
...that made me feel better. She said...

96
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:32,381
...the third wheel
is what makes it a tricycle.

97
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,481
What are you talking about?

98
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,634
Your group date with Megan and Eric.

99
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,387
At Tink's?
How'd you know about that?

100
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,181
Did Stanley tell you?

101
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,916
Stanley was on your group date?

102
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:48,857
No, Stanley was with his wife.
I waved at him but he didn't wave back.

103
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:52,016
Does anybody else know about this?

104
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,961
There he goes.

105
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:03,070
So what is the scuttlebutt?
Anybody hear anything?

106
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,163
Nothing?

107
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,453
I got a little something-something.

108
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:10,358
I don't know if I should say.
- So just keep it to yourself then.

109
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,754
Stanley is having a midlife crisis.

110
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,783
Stanley is way past
the middle of his life,

111
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:16,759
considering his height to weight ratio.

112
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,324
Apparently he and his wife...

113
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:22,097
...were out dancing
at a club for young people.

114
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,765
Teri's out of town.

115
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,874
Who?
- Stanley's wife, Teri.

116
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:28,907
She's at an interior decorating expo
in Philly.

117
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:31,907
And Stanley hates crowds,
kids, and music.

118
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:35,067
I think you should check your facts.

119
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:44,499
You stupid son of a bitch.
You set me up.

120
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,372
What are you talking about?
- Stanley's wife is out of town.

121
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,518
He was with somebody.
- Definitely.

122
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:51,873
Was he? Who, his sister?

123
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:55,049
I don't get it!

124
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:56,299
If that was his sister,

125
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,958
then what they were doing was illegal.

126
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,058
Drugs?

127
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:03,487
Making out.

128
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,757
No, it's okay.

129
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:18,236
Never mind. Carry on.

130
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,261
Stanley is having an affair.

131
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,530
What?
- I know.

132
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,430
I am very happy right now,

133
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,210
thrilled perhaps,

134
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,455
to be a part of the office,
to be a part of the conversation.

135
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,991
When you have somebody's attention
and their eyes are lighting up...

136
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,859
...because they are very interested
in what you have to say,

137
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,468
that is a great feeling
and I experienced that firsthand today.

138
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:41,761
It is wonderful
to be the center of attention.

139
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,082
That and that are the same letter.

140
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:46,182
'Q'.

141
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:49,635
He's holding a pencil.

142
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:52,312
He could be doing a crossword puzzle
with that pencil.

143
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,857
What's that letter right there?
Same letter here and here.

144
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,818
What haven't you guessed?
- 'T'.

145
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,918
'T', yes!

146
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,638
That is a 't'

147
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:05,158
and there's another one right there.

148
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,658
Just sound that out.
You're almost there.

149
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,998
Where you going, big guy?
Up to no good?

150
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,922
I'm meeting a client.
Do you have a problem?

151
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:18,491
I just had a quick question for you.
I'm casting...

152
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,371
...a movie and I'm looking
for a woman who can dance.

153
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,551
Beautiful woman.
Do you know anybody?

154
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,755
Good-bye.

155
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:26,453
Pays $5 million.

156
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:28,056
Nudity required.

157
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,474
You have to stop this.

158
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,601
Did you hear?
Stanley's having an affair.

159
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,271
I did from you.
You got to stop telling people.

160
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,417
Okay, I get it.

161
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,818
You feel out of the loop
and sorry for yourself...

162
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:38,704
...and it's really sad,

163
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,318
everybody thinks you're a loser.

164
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,558
Do you even know if it's true?
Do you have any idea? Because...

165
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:46,463
...you might be ruining his life.

166
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:53,232
Hold up! Hold up!

167
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:58,416
Time to stop being polite and get real.

168
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,488
You having an affair?

169
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,684
That is ridiculous. Of course not.
Why would you think that?

170
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,784
So it's not true.

171
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:13,727
Those interns. They told me
they saw you at the club...

172
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,003
...and they all said it was you.
It was clearly just...

173
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:20,010
...racial profiling gossip.

174
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,110
The little...
- Damn!

175
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:25,306
Told her it was a stupid idea.

176
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:26,406
That's so stupid.

177
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,506
It's just that...

178
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:31,745
Teri's been traveling a lot lately.
- I know.

179
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,079
It's been lonely.
- I bet.

180
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,499
Cynthia's been keeping me company.

181
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,092
She was my nurse...

182
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:40,213
...when I was in rehabilitation.

183
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:44,563
We used to go on these long walks
on the treadmill.

184
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,343
I didn't intend...

185
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,443
Wait, wait, wait.

186
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:52,224
So it is true?

187
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,979
But I'm going to go break it off.

188
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:56,436
That's where I'm headed right now,
I swear.

189
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,861
Wait a second.
Do people often say they're going...

190
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:01,254
...on sales calls
and then go someplace else?

191
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:02,442
That's not cool.

192
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:07,446
I just need you to promise
not to say a word about this to anyone.

193
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:08,782
Michael, please.

194
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,398
I'm not saying a damn thing.
- I'm counting on you, Michael.

195
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,498
You can count on me.

196
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:18,971
That smells good.

197
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:22,212
I might have extra.
It just depends on how many I eat.

198
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,477
Did you hear about Angela?
That's weird.

199
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:28,648
What do you mean exactly?

200
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,713
The fact that she apparently is dating...

201
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:33,210
...an 81-year-old billionaire...

202
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,572
...who owns a Quiznos on the turnpike.

203
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,672
Really?

204
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:39,452
Right?

205
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,682
How do you untell something?

206
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,479
You can't.

207
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,817
You can't put words back in your mouth.

208
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,917
What you can do...

209
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:50,482
...is spread false gossip...

210
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,452
...so that people think that everything
that's been said is untrue,

211
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,782
including Stanley is having an affair.

212
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:02,643
It's like the end of Spartacus.
I've seen that movie half a dozen times...

213
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:05,447
...and I still don't know
who the real Spartacus is.

214
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:09,967
And that is what makes
that movie a classic whodunit.

215
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,054
Kelly has an eating disorder.
She always eats my lunch.

216
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,815
Anorexia. She's ana...

217
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,433
She's an 'anorexitec.'

218
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,838
We should do something.
- Nothing can be done.

219
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:23,010
Just have to tell everybody
and hope for the best, I guess.

220
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,705
I'm worried about Erin...

221
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:26,360
...because she's not a very good worker.

222
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,295
I don't know how long she's gonna last.

223
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,395
Really?

224
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,384
So...

225
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:32,678
And Andy...

226
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:34,778
...is gay.

227
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,350
Did you hear Pam is pregnant?

228
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:41,035
Really?

229
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,424
She's gonna hate being a mom.

230
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:51,843
What?

231
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,470
Tea.

232
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,570
So?
- You would.

233
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,583
I like tea.

234
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,683
I bet you like it.

235
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,532
I like it a lot.

236
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:03,984
I love tea.

237
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:07,358
Do you like it as much
as you like men's butts?

238
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,758
What?

239
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,858
'Cause you're gay.

240
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:14,243
Who told you that?

241
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:16,348
Was it Broccoli Rob?

242
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:18,119
Someone from Chi Psi?

243
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,132
Did you run
in someone from my high school?

244
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:21,664
This is not the first time...

245
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,535
...rumors about me being gay have come up.

246
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:26,635
Twice before, actually.

247
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,291
Just a weird coincidence.

248
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,285
It's a little too weird.

249
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:38,887
Almost makes you wonder
if it's not a coincidence at all.

250
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,987
Which it is, of course.

251
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:44,172
But it makes you wonder.

252
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,065
Did you hear the rumor about me?

253
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,479
That I'm gay?

254
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:50,579
I did.

255
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:52,161
And?

256
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,261
What?

257
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:57,966
Do you think it's true?
Do you think that I'm...

258
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:58,910
...gay?

259
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,645
Are you attracted to other men?

260
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,502
Let me kick you a scenario.

261
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,704
I'm at, like, a beach cabana...

262
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,923
...and Brad Pitt approaches,

263
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,488
tries to lean in and kiss me.

264
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:18,033
I would definitely resist,

265
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:19,756
like, at first.

266
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,981
But if he was persistent,

267
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,651
I might...

268
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:27,503
...give in a little bit
to just really see what it felt like.

269
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,289
Would I push him away?

270
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,896
How hard?

271
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:33,445
Like, what if he's,
like, really aggressive?

272
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,200
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit,

273
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
he would still...

274
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,970
...need to get to you?
- This is not real Brad Pitt.

275
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,681
This is, like, in my...
This is my fantasy.

276
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,464
Or it's, like, not fantasy.
It's, like, what I'm...

277
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,564
It's a scenario.

278
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,721
I wish I could help you. I don't...

279
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,284
You might be gay.

280
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:55,384
You might be gay.

281
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:59,262
What exactly is my responsibility here?

282
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,828
To comfort insecure heterosexual men?

283
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,017
That can't possibly fall to me.

284
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,685
How far is Pam?
- A few months.

285
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,109
That's why they're rushing the wedding.

286
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:09,985
You can't believe everything you hear.

287
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:12,261
Like Stanley having an affair.

288
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:13,701
That is crazy.

289
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:15,618
Just there's no stock in it.

290
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,754
It's a weird day for false facts.

291
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:18,988
Let it go.

292
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:20,563
OK, everybody.

293
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:23,553
Big day. Last day for our interns.

294
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,079
Lot of other stuff.

295
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,423
Who knows what to believe?

296
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:30,043
Dwight, the honors.

297
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:33,606
Present these to the dean for credit.

298
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,608
And as a gift,
I've attached my card.

299
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,909
Call me anytime of the day or night.

300
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:40,215
Why would we call you at night?

301
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:42,852
Now you can't call me at all,
so problem solved.

302
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,146
You will regret when you find yourself...

303
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:46,705
...between a moose and her cubs.

304
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,670
Look to the intern on your left.

305
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,907
Now to your right.

306
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:52,357
One of you will do
exceedingly well in business.

307
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,304
Just unlimited potential.

308
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:57,702
One of you will make a living
and nothing more.

309
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:59,030
And one of you...

310
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,510
...will make a great mother.

311
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:06,770
It's up to you
to choose which you want to be.

312
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,076
I am so happy you're eating again.

313
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,370
Me too.

314
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,087
Dude, how come you never try
to set me up?

315
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,423
I don't really do that.
Pam might have some friends though.

316
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,173
Women friends?

317
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,882
Not guy friends?

318
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:24,212
Are you interested in her guy friends?

319
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:26,453
For the record, I prefer women.

320
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:29,492
But off the record,
I'm kind of confused.

321
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:30,562
Really?

322
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,570
The evidence is stacked against me,

323
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,773
I feel like.

324
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,110
You got to figure this out.
- Yeah, right? How?

325
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,547
You got to have sex with a woman.

326
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:43,217
Right-o.
- And then a man and then compare.

327
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:47,577
All right.

328
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:50,737
Congratulations to you.
- On what?

329
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,319
Come on.

330
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:54,124
Little baby tuna.

331
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,250
Little junior toro.

332
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,099
A baby conceived out of wedlock
is still a bastard.

333
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,464
What?

334
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:05,847
Want me to say it again?

335
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:10,537
Why did that come into your brain?
- Can I talk to you?

336
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,061
So they know.

337
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,480
Who did you tell?
- I didn't tell anyone. And you?

338
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,592
Nobody.

339
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:19,582
Did one of you tell Stanley
that I have asthma, 'cause I don't.

340
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:22,030
If it gets out,
they won't let me scuba.

341
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,763
If I can't scuba,

342
00:15:23,863 --> 00:15:27,118
then what's this all been about?
What am I working toward?

343
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,329
What?

344
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,582
You think I'm the voice
of the Taco Bell Dog?

345
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,957
What are you talking about?

346
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,522
I have a daughter.
How could I be a virgin?

347
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:40,297
Has everyone heard
a crazy rumor about themselves today?

348
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:42,519
You know what?
Let's discredit these rumors.

349
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,844
Sure, but who's been saying
all that stuff?

350
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,944
That's not important,

351
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,222
We shouldn't listen to this crap.

352
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,099
We should get to the bottom of this.

353
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,101
Let's pick a rumor and trace it back.

354
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,241
I need to do mine first.

355
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:57,869
Who's been saying that
there's another person inside of me...

356
00:15:57,969 --> 00:16:00,349
...working me with controls?

357
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,501
I heard that from Andy.

358
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:04,748
I heard it from Erin.

359
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:07,277
I heard it from Michael.

360
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:14,231
He's over here!

361
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,541
Where you going?
- Nowhere.

362
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,538
You told people
that I use store-bought manure...

363
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:28,633
...when I showed you
where my manure comes from.

364
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:33,393
Don't get on it.
- Michael, don't.

365
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,229
Don't get on.

366
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,105
Do not.

367
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,244
Stay, Michael.
- Step away.

368
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:41,809
Come on, boss.

369
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:44,844
Okay, I made it all up.

370
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:45,939
What?

371
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,334
Even the fact that I'm gay?

372
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,314
But, guys, I'm a victim here too.

373
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,997
People have been saying
that I am a J. Crew model.

374
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,477
No, we heard that about Jim.

375
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,888
I spread the rumor
that somebody was a J. Crew model...

376
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:02,630
...and I was referring to myself.

377
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,162
How is that a bad rumor?
- 'Cause people think that models,

378
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:09,439
even though they're very attractive
are somewhat vapid.

379
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,305
It set our industry back quite a bit.

380
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,765
Michael, why?
Why say all these things?

381
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:16,694
Why make up an eating disorder,
Stanley's affair,

382
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:18,312
me being a spokes dog?

383
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,940
You told everyone I was having an affair?

384
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Here's the thing.

385
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,308
There was one true rumor out there today.

386
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:27,824
I didn't want everybody
to know what it was,

387
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:31,409
so all of you are off the hook
except for this one person.

388
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,509
Well, then what's the one true rumor?

389
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:35,649
We have a right to know.

390
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,523
Am I gay?

391
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,016
The one true rumor...

392
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:43,039
This is gonna ruin
this person's life, is...

393
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:44,418
That Pam's pregnant.

394
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:46,518
I knew it.
- I knew it.

395
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:49,218
Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger.

396
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,050
At first I thought,

397
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,047
she has a new bra with padding.

398
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:56,887
But then I thought,
Pam doesn't need padding.

399
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,580
It just didn't add up, Jim.

400
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,291
Congratulations.
- That's really great.

401
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:04,835
Don't vaccinate it.
- Who's the father?

402
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:06,807
How far along?
- Four months.

403
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:08,502
Who's the ob-gyn?
- Stop.

404
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:10,390
All right, you know...

405
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,938
This is not the truth...

406
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:14,494
...and you can't fall on a sword this way.

407
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,621
The real thing is that Stanley Hudson...

408
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,721
...had an affair.

409
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:23,028
Thank you to defend us, but actually,
Pam is pregnant and we can prove it.

410
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:25,763
If you would like to see proof.

411
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:30,943
Just gonna wait for her?
- What's the 'proof' mean?

412
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:35,783
There it is!
- It's true!

413
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:38,019
Look at that!

414
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,564
That is the inside of your vagina.

415
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:42,522
That's not how it works, but...

416
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,619
It's clear
why we were trying not to tell people.

417
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,719
That's clear now.

418
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:56,160
How long have you known
about the pregnancy?

419
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
A week? Month?

420
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,966
A year?

421
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,208
We only told our parents last week.

422
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,943
Did you pee on a stick?
- I did.

423
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:06,793
But it was inconclusive.

424
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:08,933
You should have told me.

425
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,725
You're right.

426
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:16,755
We should have realized
that you are an equal part of this.

427
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:21,036
Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.

428
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,346
You called Stanley's wife?

429
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:27,587
A long time ago.
Just to make sure she was out of town.

430
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:29,360
God.
- Don't take it.

431
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,249
I have to take it
or it'll seem suspicious.

432
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:33,635
If you talk to her,
you're gonna tell her...

433
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:36,367
...and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
- I can do this.

434
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,378
You can't do this.
- I can. I am going to tell her...

435
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,771
...that I need to redecorate my condo
and I need her help.

436
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:45,700
We will haggle about money
and I will back down...

437
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,088
...and then I won't talk to her
until this Cynthia thing's blown over.

438
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,638
Sounds terrible.
- Please don't.

439
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,738
What up, Cynthia?

440
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:03,008
Just hang on a second, Cynthia.

441
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,346
It turns out
that Teri was already suspicious...

442
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,720
...because she had caught Stanley...

443
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,789
...and Cynthia a few months ago.

444
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:20,889
So Stanley promised...

445
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,870
...that he would stop and he did.

446
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,970
End of story. Well...

447
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:27,002
...not exactly.

448
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,337
Cynthia kept calling him.

449
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,047
She would not stop calling him
and she was in love with him.

450
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,132
And get this.

451
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,115
Cynthia? Also married.

452
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:36,719
So...

453
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,539
...you can't stop love, I guess.

454
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:41,285
And quite frankly,

455
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:44,700
I don't think you should ever even try.

456
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,880
I learned that a company
can describe an internship...

457
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,955
...as full of exciting experiences,

458
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:54,247
even if that's a lie.

459
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:55,986
There's no regulation.

460
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:58,227
I learned that half
these people's email password...

461
00:20:58,327 --> 00:20:59,742
...is 'password.'

462
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,902
I learned that a ream of paper...

463
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:03,002
...is 300 sheets.

464
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:06,162
I thought it was 500.

465
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:10,276
I guess I didn't learn anything.

466
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:13,664
I learned that if you look
even the tiniest bit like Jet Li...

467
00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:16,448
...Michael will call you
Jet Li all summer.

468
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:20,548
Julia Stiles.
- Alan Thicke.
