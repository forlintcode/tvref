1
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:14,419
Nce between a chimichanga,

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,338
a chalupa, and a tostada?

3
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:20,086
Call me back asap.

4
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,616
It's urgent.

5
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:24,588
This isn't funny.

6
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,241
I don't talk like that.

7
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:29,191
Say, "me eat cookie."

8
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:31,247
No. I won't say it.

9
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,666
Why is everyone clumped
around accounting?

10
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:33,802
Break it up, you clique.

11
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:35,525
It's Kevin as cookie monster

12
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:36,360
from <i>Sesame Street.</i>

13
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:37,873
Is that the program

14
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,011
where all those puppets
live in the barrio?

15
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:40,796
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that show.

16
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:43,070
This is Kevin. This is Kevin.

17
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:44,716
Thank you.

18
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:45,610
That is an amusing link.

19
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:47,438
I'd like it sent to me,
please. - Yes.

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,058
Me too, Oscar.
Please send it to me.

21
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:50,654
C.C. Me.

22
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,567
Angela, this is inappropriate.

23
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:54,318
This is my favorite day.

24
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:15,915
Sync by dny238
www.addic7ed.com

25
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,024
It's secretary's day.

26
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:21,108
And it is Erin's and my
three-week anniversary.

27
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:24,631
So perfect storm for
a romantic gesture.

28
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:27,402
Want to make sure the
whole office remembers

29
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,559
it's secretary's day.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,164
I sent an email blast,
a text blast,

31
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,111
a good, old-fashioned talk blast.

32
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:34,281
I sent a snail mail
blast a week ago.

33
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:37,435
And a stern reminder via fax at 7:00 
this morning,

34
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:38,917
so people better step up

35
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,648
and appreciate the
crap out of Erin.

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,193
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

37
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:44,152
I do.

38
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:47,213
Thank you.

39
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:50,244
If it wasn't for secretaries,

40
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,428
I wouldn't have a stepmom.

41
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:55,062
- Welcome back.
- Hey, thanks.

42
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,330
It's my first day back
after maternity leave.

43
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,810
And I miss Cece, of course.

44
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:01,134
But we need the money.

45
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:03,754
What was maternity leave like?

46
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,880
Oh, how do I explain it?
It rocked.

47
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,799
It rocked my ass off.

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,570
Oh. You couldn't have watered it?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,988
I literally did not
know that existed

50
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:17,819
until this moment.

51
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:22,252
Well, I knew it existed,
and I chose to let it die.

52
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,265
It's nice to see
you again, Dwight.

53
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,378
Hello, Pam.

54
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,821
I was just wondering
what you had planned

55
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:28,737
for secretary's day.

56
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:30,093
I'm going to give Erin $15.

57
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:33,598
I know that Erin
would be so psyched

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,978
if you took her out to lunch.

59
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:37,080
- A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:38,586
She really looks up to you.

61
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:40,795
And there's only so much
we can do as her coworkers.

62
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:44,718
Secretary's day is really kind
of a boss-secretary thing.

63
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:49,299
She's kind of a rube.

64
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,231
That's my girlfriend
you're talking about.

65
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:53,750
Okay. All right. All right.

66
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,068
Okay. I'll take her to lunch.

67
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,131
She's gonna be so psyched.

68
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,408
Hi, Erin.

69
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:00,563
Happy secretary's day.

70
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:01,624
Well, happy boss's day.

71
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,772
There wouldn't be a secretary
if there was no boss.

72
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,815
I wanted to know what
your plans for lunch were

73
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:07,963
because I was hoping
to ask you to...

74
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:09,928
Lunch.

75
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,982
I got a picture of
you asking me to lunch.

76
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:14,704
I was thinking we could
go to Hayworth's.

77
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,217
- Ugh.
- Just the two of us.

78
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:18,462
Well, Hayworth's is
more business casual,

79
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:20,295
and they always
screw up your order.

80
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:22,770
So I'm... - Yeah, okay.

81
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:24,385
Yeah, that was a
stupid suggestion.

82
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:25,880
I was thinking someplace special,

83
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:27,438
so I thought Hayworth's, but...

84
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,899
Okay, well,
we'll figure something.

85
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,726
Oh.

86
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,520
Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.

87
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:35,596
- Okay.
- All right.

88
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:37,707
Have a cookie, kev.

89
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,334
Yeah, ha ha. Tray of cookie.

90
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:41,738
I'm not falling for that.

91
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,185
I brought those in.

92
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:44,125
It's my birthday.

93
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:46,659
That's some stone-cold
narcissism right there.

94
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,381
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry.

95
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:51,847
Happy Birthday. - Thank you.

96
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:55,574
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

97
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:59,007
They're making fun
of cookie monster.

98
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:00,119
I get that.

99
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,092
But in a strange way, it feels

100
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,130
like they're making fun of me.

101
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:08,236
Oscar, did you eat
some of my m&m's?

102
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:10,907
The level-- - this is
violent and offensive.

103
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:12,053
Thank you.

104
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:15,324
It really make me
self-conscious about my voice.

105
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:18,850
- It's awful.
- I'm not crying.

106
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,972
You have some food on your face.

107
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:24,641
Do my hands feel sweaty to you?

108
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:26,812
The beginning here has been
a little bit of a fiasco.

109
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:30,582
Either they don't respect me
or they respect me too much.

110
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,417
And some of them still think
that I'm the I.T. Guy.

111
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,113
This cookie monster
thing is an opportunity

112
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:39,166
to show people that I'm
an authority figure.

113
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:43,605
Hello, everyone.

114
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:45,479
If I might have a
moment of your time.

115
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,351
It's come to my attention
that people have been watching

116
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,929
and laughing at a
hurtful parody video.

117
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,724
It is now forbidden to talk,
joke about,

118
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:55,720
or email this around.

119
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:57,386
Yeah.

120
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:58,677
And that's straight
from corporate.

121
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,787
So, not to be scary,

122
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:02,528
but, yeah, I would listen to me.

123
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:03,575
And that's all.

124
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,199
Ciao.

125
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:15,383
Would you mind if I
listen to my book on tape?

126
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm kind of a bookworm.

127
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,407
This is a novelization
of the movie

128
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:23,055
<i>Based on the book</i> push <i>by sapphire.</i>

129
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,754
I was thinking it would be
fun to talk on the way over.

130
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:28,856
So what decade would you
have chosen to be a teenager?

131
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,388
I don't know.

132
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:35,595
I would have chosen the 1490s.

133
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:38,635
'Cause America was discovered.

134
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:39,264
Right.

135
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,973
And then my last job was
at a taco bell express.

136
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,647
But then it became
a full taco bell,

137
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:49,481
and I don't know,
I couldn't keep up.

138
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,429
My favorite part about
being a receptionist

139
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,898
is that I get to have my own desk.

140
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,664
In my foster home,
I never had a desk.

141
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:58,195
So it's like--I don't mean that
I didn't like my foster home.

142
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,236
I did like it.

143
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,798
I just didn't have a desk there.

144
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,895
Did you have a favorite age?

145
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,211
Or month?

146
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:06,827
An age or month?

147
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:07,932
Yeah, like a favorite month.

148
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,108
Like, I like April
when I was seven.

149
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:12,316
I've been trying.
I've been trying

150
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,139
to keep it going.

151
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:19,153
Erin is just weird.

152
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:21,200
How many pillows do
you sleep on at night?

153
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,825
So how are things
going with Andy?

154
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,447
He's the best
boyfriend in the world.

155
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,851
Tell me about him
before I met him.

156
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:30,604
Well, let's see.

157
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,844
Um... Andy.

158
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,245
Plays the banjo.

159
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:36,942
Yeah. I love that.

160
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:39,455
Other than the fact
that he dated Angela,

161
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:41,847
I don't think he is
a snappy dresser.

162
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,727
What?

163
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:45,044
I don't think he
is the best dresser.

164
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:47,848
Reminds me of Easter.
Sorry. About Angela?

165
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:50,359
Did you say he dated Angela?

166
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:52,465
Mm-hmm.

167
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:53,751
You didn't know that?

168
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:55,840
Oh. - Here we go. Hot plate.

169
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:58,050
- Okay.
- And your salad, miss.

170
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:00,979
Why wouldn't he tell me that?

171
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,299
I don't know.

172
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,909
Probably didn't want you
to have a mental image

173
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,461
of him having sex
with somebody else.

174
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:08,450
They had sex?

175
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,323
They were engaged, so...

176
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:14,150
Okay. You know what, sir?

177
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:15,792
Yes.

178
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:17,297
Yeah, I asked for
pickles with my burger,

179
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:18,762
and there are only,
like, five or six.

180
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:19,865
Could I get some more pickles?

181
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:22,491
Of course. I'll get
you a bowl of pickles.

182
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,764
- Thank you.
- They were engaged?

183
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:26,162
Mm-hmm.

184
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:28,514
Yeah.

185
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,301
- Uh-oh.
- Well...

186
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,579
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

187
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,603
In the foster home,
my hair was my room.

188
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:50,565
Okay. You know what?

189
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,946
You know what? You know what?

190
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:53,146
Everybody's looking
at you right now.

191
00:07:58,153 --> 00:07:59,475
I'll have what she's having.

192
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,127
- Did you have a-
- did you like your lunch?

193
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,135
Did you have a good lunch?

194
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:13,887
Did you like that?
Did you enjoy your food?

195
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:16,430
It was good. I liked my lunch.

196
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,343
Ooh.

197
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:19,721
Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.

198
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:22,519
- What's up?
- Her milk is coming in.

199
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,427
She's getting uncomfortable.

200
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:24,699
Dwight, don't be gross.

201
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,969
No, no, he's right.

202
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,458
Same thing happens with my cows

203
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,855
if I don't tend them
frequently enough.

204
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,849
You gotta milk them,
or else they'll moo like crazy.

205
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,711
That's weird.
My breast pump is missing.

206
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:35,577
Have you seen my breast pump?

207
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,051
All right,
this is gonna traumatize me

208
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:40,217
a hell of a lot more than you,
believe me.

209
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:41,947
You know what, Dwight?

210
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,580
Let me just check
the bathroom first.

211
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,840
Okay? - Really? Fine.

212
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:46,965
Let your breasts explode.

213
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:49,599
Three squeezes and
I would drain you.

214
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,911
Mm.

215
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:55,413
Meredith!

216
00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:56,484
I just like the way it feels.

217
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:57,612
What are you doing?

218
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:59,123
- Relax. Okay.
- Relax?

219
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,213
This is like the
Cadillac of pumps.

220
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,276
Give it back to me now.

221
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,232
Okay, I was just warming it up.

222
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,682
It's disgusting!

223
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:07,772
- It's not a big deal.
- It's not sterile!

224
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:09,219
We're both girls. Who cares?

225
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,054
So...

226
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:26,616
How was lunch?

227
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:27,710
Lunch was fine.

228
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,760
Was it everything that you
hoped and dreamed it might be?

229
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:34,518
I don't know.
It was lunch, Andy.

230
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,332
Well, I know.

231
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:39,337
Just want-- I mean...

232
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,922
Erin?

233
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:44,736
I think we're out
of fax cover sheets.

234
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:46,189
God, Oscar,
will you keep your pants on?

235
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,066
It's easy.

236
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,528
"My name is Kevin.

237
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,768
I'm an accountant."

238
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:56,333
See, I did the voice.

239
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,476
That's a little derivative.

240
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:59,535
But parody is always derivative.

241
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,532
Uh, it's not organic.

242
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,742
Do you know what I mean?
Jim does a really good one.

243
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,398
Do yours. - Oh, guys.

244
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,702
I really refuse to participate.

245
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:08,784
"Michael, can I have an
advance on my paycheck

246
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:12,451
because a Mrs. field cookie
just opened up at the mall."

247
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,290
Guys, why don't we
leave the parodies

248
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,959
to the pros at madtv?

249
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,997
"Sorry, Gabe, but that show
hasn't been on in many cookies."

250
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,253
Okay.

251
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:24,197
Hey, can I have your
attention, please?

252
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:25,937
First of all, thanks to everyone

253
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:28,875
for helping put this
awesome party together.

254
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:32,009
And a very special
shout-out to the chair

255
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,477
of the party planning committee,
miss Angela Martin.

256
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:36,564
You have outdone yourself.

257
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:40,212
You know what,
I think we can all agree

258
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:42,038
that Angela's not so great, so...

259
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,968
I am saying the exact opposite.

260
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:45,415
Angela is fantastic.

261
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,059
No. No. No.

262
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,290
- Specific shout-out...
- Stop talking.

263
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,539
Okay.

264
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,745
As some of you may know,

265
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:55,296
I have a very special
connection to secretary's day

266
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:59,621
in the form of that 115-pound
moonbeam over there

267
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:00,487
named Erin hannon.

268
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,555
To a lot of you she
may just be the person

269
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:04,046
who brings you your
fax confirmations,

270
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:07,254
but to me, she is my girlfriend...

271
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:09,098
In addition to being the person

272
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:10,644
who brings me my
fax confirmations.

273
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:15,479
So I wrote a Little ditty

274
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:19,249
that I would like to play
for all of you right now.

275
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,856
It's a little tune called

276
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:25,789
<i>secretary of love.</i>

277
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,766
A one, a two,

278
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:28,967
a one, two, three--

279
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,416
I know about Angela.

280
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,321
I know that you
were engaged to her

281
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:34,573
and that you were
sleeping with her.

282
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,717
Michael told me. - Oh, God.

283
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,452
Erin, can we talk
about this in private?

284
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:40,262
I don't want it
to be in private.

285
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:41,224
Is it true or is it not?

286
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,243
- Yes.
- Who else did you sleep with?

287
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:50,659
Did you sleep with
Phyllis or Kelly or Pam?

288
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,900
Maybe all together?

289
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,906
- No. No, never.
- Did everyone know?

290
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:55,153
Was I the only one
who didn't know?

291
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:56,580
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Pretty much.

292
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:59,331
Who are you? I don't know you.

293
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,861
I don't know <i>you!</i>

294
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,319
I should probably
get involved in this,

295
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,788
but I think my energy
is better spent

296
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,567
on the cookie monster issue.

297
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,932
Erin, you know,
if I had been engaged

298
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,640
to anybody before you,

299
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:17,977
I would have told you.

300
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:20,415
Thanks.

301
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,059
So if you need anything,

302
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,676
I'm right over there.

303
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,054
"Hey, Erin, you look delicious.

304
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:31,128
I mean, beautiful."

305
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:32,598
Okay.

306
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,850
Okay. There. I heard that.

307
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,806
So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it.

308
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,601
I'm going to have to
suspend you without pay

309
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:41,327
for two days.

310
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,861
What? What do you mean,
suspend me?

311
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,608
I think you need
to go a little easy.

312
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:47,237
You can't just suspend
someone from work.

313
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:48,573
Yeah, you're right.
You know what?

314
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:50,149
Um, you're suspended too, Jim.

315
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,886
Okay. - Fine. You too, Dwight.

316
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,043
Wait, what?

317
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,084
I was just slow-clapping

318
00:12:58,085 --> 00:12:59,431
your no-nonsense decision-making.

319
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,516
I don't want to hear it.

320
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:02,120
Suspended.

321
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:06,906
"C" is for suspension.

322
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:13,340
Why would that be something
that you would talk about

323
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:14,472
on secretary's day?

324
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:16,427
Andy, she's not the
easiest person in the world

325
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,551
to have a conversation with.

326
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:18,852
All right? And besides,

327
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,019
who doesn't tell their girlfriend

328
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,795
that they were engaged to someone

329
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:24,858
who works four feet
away from them?

330
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:26,406
That's like-- that's--

331
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,212
that's, like, <i>mr. And Mrs.
smith</i> crap.

332
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:29,438
I was gonna tell her,

333
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,882
just on my own time.

334
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:32,273
You know what,
I resent the implication

335
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:34,308
that I would keep that secret.

336
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:36,668
Everyone here knows that I can't

337
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:37,868
and won't keep a secret.

338
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,332
Who cares?

339
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,316
I mean, it's not like
I killed somebody.

340
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,092
Big deal, right?

341
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,833
This can blow over in two seconds.

342
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,788
She never asked me, so,
if you think about it...

343
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,417
I probably should have
told her, I guess.

344
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:54,088
Everybody does stupid things.

345
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,371
Psst. Hey.

346
00:13:59,143 --> 00:14:01,957
Erin. - You want to talk to me,

347
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:02,778
come to my desk.

348
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:15,290
You embarrassed me earlier.

349
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,877
Oh, take it up with
the chief of police.

350
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,925
You think I want
people remembering

351
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,171
I had sensual relations with Andy?

352
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:24,164
It's the kind of thing you
wish you could have annulled.

353
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:26,377
I want to throw up
just thinking about it.

354
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,065
<i>I</i> want to throw up just
thinking about it.

355
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,650
You are throwing up
for the wrong reasons.

356
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:33,545
I don't think this
fax is going through.

357
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:37,258
Is there a different...

358
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,226
I can just put it
through again, you know.

359
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:49,112
Hey.

360
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:54,034
You know, I was
engaged before Jim.

361
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:56,806
Really?

362
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,068
Yeah. And he worked here too.

363
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,318
It was Andy, wasn't it?

364
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:03,764
No, no, it wasn't Andy.

365
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:05,085
It wasn't.

366
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:06,217
It doesn't matter.

367
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:10,299
It's not about who
you've been with.

368
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,403
It's about who you end up with.

369
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,768
Sometimes the heart
doesn't know what it wants

370
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:17,356
until it finds what it wants.

371
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,291
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

372
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,583
Thank you.

373
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,336
So I can reprimand them,
but I can't suspend them.

374
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,087
Oh, I can't do either.

375
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,478
Uh-huh. Fair enough.

376
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,458
Hey, Toby.

377
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:55,756
I called Tallahassee.

378
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:57,193
He can ask you not to come in,

379
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:58,683
but he can't dock your pay.

380
00:15:58,684 --> 00:16:00,485
That's not legal.
Very interesting.

381
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,285
Yeah, I also learned
some interesting things

382
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:03,217
about how they structure--

383
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:04,883
thanks, Toby.

384
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:06,955
Hey, everyone. Hi.

385
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:09,917
Quite an afternoon, huh?

386
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,419
Cathartic in a way.

387
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,162
I'm glad that I got
to share it with you.

388
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:16,046
It makes you think about
what's really important.

389
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:18,281
It's not about showing
you're in charge

390
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:19,995
or flexing some sort of authority.

391
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:21,244
It's about forgiveness.

392
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,878
And, yes, I'm talking
about you three

393
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,952
in this desk clump right here.

394
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:27,158
I think that, if you
were to apologize to me,

395
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,535
then I would revoke
your suspension.

396
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:31,509
I don't think an
apology is enough.

397
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,018
I really think the only way
for me to learn my lesson

398
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,633
is to take my suspension.

399
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:39,157
And I got to take
this bad attitude,

400
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:41,608
and I got to go home,
and I got to adjust it.

401
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,395
And I hope the
suspension does that.

402
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:44,942
Prideful idiots.

403
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:46,191
Watch how it's done.

404
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:49,594
Gabriel, I apologize.

405
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:51,367
Great.

406
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:54,101
I kneel before you.

407
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,523
Guys, I would even
take a contrite look

408
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:58,543
as an apology.

409
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:00,842
Humbly taking your
hand upon which I kiss

410
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:01,998
to show my contrition.

411
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:06,989
Guys, to err is human.

412
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:15,115
Trust is the most
important thing to me.

413
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,240
Is your name Andy Bernard?

414
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:18,612
What's your real name?
Lionel frankenstein?

415
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:20,335
Will you stop walking
for one second?

416
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:22,655
That's it.
There's no other secrets.

417
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:26,509
Okay? I mean, yeah,

418
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,396
my chest is not
naturally hairless,

419
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:30,345
and my parents pay
my credit card bill.

420
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:31,656
How long were you guys together?

421
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:35,687
- A year.
- A year?

422
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,493
You were together for a year.

423
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,325
Yeah. But that's it.

424
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,744
Now you know everything about me.

425
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:45,400
I promise.

426
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:46,801
And if I think of anything else...

427
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:51,160
I think I have to be on
my own for a little bit.

428
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:53,251
Like that girl precious
in <i>precious:</i>

429
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:55,090
<i>Based on the novel</i> push <i>by sapphire.</i>

430
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:56,760
Okay?

431
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,949
I didn't see that movie.

432
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:05,061
That was ugly.

433
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,516
I'm sorry that you
had to see that.

434
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:07,632
Do they still get paid?

435
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,173
It's tacky to discuss finances.

436
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:11,556
It's best to pretend
that this never happened.

437
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,696
Sounds like they just
got to go home with pay.

438
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:14,862
- Yeah.
- Pathetic.

439
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:17,797
- Very nice.
- Can I buy everyone coffees?

440
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,485
"Or cookies."

441
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:26,010
- Oh.
- What was that?

442
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:27,911
Was that an impression?

443
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:28,926
All right.

444
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,329
Uh, guys,

445
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,915
I'm now going to apologize

446
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,340
for the mess that we're in.

447
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:36,762
Because corporate told me to.

448
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:40,483
I just want you to know I
laugh like a crazy person.

449
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:41,959
Okay.

450
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,523
You got to be able to-
you got to be able

451
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:43,881
to laugh at yourself.

452
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:45,203
I'm one of the gang.

453
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:47,318
"I have to go back to the zoo

454
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,067
to the stick insect exhibit."

455
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:54,156
"Ciao."

456
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,579
Right? "Ciao.

457
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,528
I say ciao 'cause I'm
fancy from Tallahassee."

458
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:03,324
Why don't we say "ciao"
to the impressions?

459
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:05,285
Ciao.

460
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:08,613
- Ciao. Filming.
- Ciao, stick insect.

461
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,456
Ciao.

462
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:12,949
God.

463
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:17,463
- Erin?
- Oh.

464
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,721
Sorry. I thought
everyone was gone.

465
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,394
No, no, I was just
watching cookie monster.

466
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,301
Finally downloaded.
Mind if I sit down?

467
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,337
- Yeah.
- What's, um...

468
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:29,559
I can't trust Andy anymore.

469
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,370
Oh. Yep.

470
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,209
I'm sorry about that.

471
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,612
I feel-- I'm sorry I
caused that thing.

472
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:36,746
It's Andy's fault.

473
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,556
Well, yeah, yes.

474
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,517
But I still feel sorry.

475
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,520
Oh.

476
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:46,857
You know what,
I wouldn't worry about Angela.

477
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:50,362
She's-- she doesn't hold a candle

478
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:51,436
to you, Erin.

479
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:55,105
She's old enough to be
your mom for one thing,

480
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,980
and she's, like, three feet tall.

481
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,432
And she wears pioneer
women clothing.

482
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:07,542
And I don't think
she's ever pooped

483
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:08,828
in her life.

484
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:11,840
And Andy, you know, come on.

485
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:14,550
Andy, his butt looks
big in those khakis.

486
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:16,680
Oh, I like his butt.

487
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,014
You said butt.

488
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:21,312
- You tricked me.
- Ahh!

489
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:22,792
Ahh.

490
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,693
You said it.
You know who'd you love?

491
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:28,614
Oh, this guy

492
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:30,317
in my neighborhood, Tom dizemore.

493
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:34,985
This is him. "Hey! Hey, Scott!"

494
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:36,891
Sometimes,
telling someone something

495
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:38,702
is hard.

496
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:44,198
Well, at least somebody made
her happy on secretary's day.

497
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,975
Hey, Kevin, it's Oscar.

498
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,479
I'm looking at the
sheet you sent me.

499
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,118
And I can't seem to find the
column for shipping costs

500
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,961
I made the most brilliant
the retaliation video.

501
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,639
It is so awesome.

502
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,887
I don't get it.

503
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:02,019
Yeah, I mean, the Count
has a very distinct voice.

504
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,076
Yeah. "I vant to count to ten."

505
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,914
But Oscar is an accountant,

506
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:09,429
and the Count counts numbers.

507
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,450
Your an accountant too,
so, it doesn't...

508
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:12,750
Why didn't you do Oscar the grouch

509
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,572
that would have been funny.
That would have been funny.

510
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,626
But the Count is purple,
and Oscar wears purple.

511
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,714
Oh! Oh! I was just watching that.

512
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:21,325
Did you do that man?

513
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:22,662
Oscar!

514
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:24,142
I am the Count...

515
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:26,295
Nailed him. Nailed him!

516
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:27,624
Good work cookie monster.

517
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,560
Thank you
