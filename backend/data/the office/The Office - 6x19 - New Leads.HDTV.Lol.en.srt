1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,041
Hey, jim, jim!

2
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,409
Come here.

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,744
Do you know who that is?

4
00:00:06,812 --> 00:00:07,813
No.
- Look at him.

5
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:09,648
Look at him, t-shirt, jeans.

6
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:13,284
Is it you?
- I am flattered.

7
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:14,753
That's johnny depp.

8
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:17,089
Where'd you take that?
- In my condo complex.

9
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,523
Oh, my god, that's right!

10
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:19,958
I read in people magazine

11
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,094
That he was looking for a
two-bedroom condo in scranton.

12
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:24,194
I'm flippin' out, man.

13
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:28,967
Hey, jim, jim,

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,671
Where--where do I find the black pearl?

15
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,540
Who's that?
- Captain jack sparrow.

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,709
captain jack sparrow, jim.

17
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:37,444
John dillinger.

18
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:40,379
No. I'm captain jack sparrow.

19
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:41,848
Captain crunch.

20
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:43,650
Okay. Okay.

21
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,750
Screw you, halpert.

22
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:48,856
You know, it's not easy
getting excited about stuff.

23
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:50,090
Remember how you felt

24
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,458
When you thought you'd
seen roger clemens?

25
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:52,693
At the yankees game.

26
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:54,361
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
- I had...

27
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:56,563
A little better reason to believe that...

28
00:00:56,663 --> 00:00:59,098
You're right. You're right.

29
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,368
Well, you're not right,
because johnny depp

30
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:03,170
In your condo complex...
I know. I know!

31
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,039
It also explains why

32
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:08,454
The name on his mailbox was m. Shulman.

33
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,611
M. Night shulman?

34
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:22,475

...<font color='#ffff00'>www.addic7ed.

36
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:38,238
First up, the lost and found

37
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,706
Has gone missing.

38
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:42,041
It itself is lost.

39
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,210
So please try not to lose anything

40
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,478
Until we find it.

41
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:46,013
Ah, pet day.

42
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:47,514
If you don't have a pet,
please don't feel--

43
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:49,716
When are we getting to sales topics?

44
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,151
Yeah. What about those leads?

45
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:52,452
Did you hear anything from corporate?

46
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:53,754
Ah, yes, the leads.

47
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:57,224
The leads that sabre has
spent $50,000 to get

48
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:58,659
From a market research company...

49
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,360
Are not here yet.

50
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,562
Oh, man... But will be...

51
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:02,796
Damn it!

52
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:04,798
No, no, no, no. Meeting's not over.

53
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:06,900
But is there anything relevant
to the sales staff here?

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,702
No sales topic, per se.

55
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:11,904
Well, then no andy bernard, per se.

56
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,807
I agree. - Dwight.

57
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:15,409
Sorry. Michael,
I got calls to make.

58
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,144
I would like your undivided
attention, please.

59
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:21,047
You couldn't handle my
undivided attention.

60
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:22,749
Over the last few weeks,

61
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,952
Things have been changing here.

62
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:29,189
Sabre says it is our duty
to support the sales team,

63
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:31,792
And the salesmen are letting
it go to their heads.

64
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,961
I think it's kind of screwed up.

65
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:36,096
Because the way this
place used to work was

66
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:38,732
Make friends first,
make sales second,

67
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:40,300
Make love third...

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,803
In no particular order.

69
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,807
Listen, michael,

70
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:49,042
About what happened earlier...

71
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:50,577
Yeah?

72
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:52,145
When I was asking about the leads.

73
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:53,647
Mm-hmm.

74
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:56,116
Is there any news on the leads?

75
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,551
Is that all you have to say to me?

76
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:00,153
Yeah. You got any news on the leads?

77
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:02,355
Okay, I tell you what.

78
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,224
I'm going out on a very
important sales call.

79
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:06,560
You get any news about the leads,
you try me.

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,562
All of my numbers.
All six of my numbers, okay?

81
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:13,032
Including the car phone!

82
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,568
All right, dwight out!

83
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:16,436
Salesman is king.

84
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:18,872
As the best salesman,
I am king of kings.

85
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:22,508
Oh, you say jesus is king of kings?

86
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,578
Well, what does that say to you

87
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:28,147
About how I think of myself?

88
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:33,552
do you not answer emails anymore?

89
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,555
Because I've emailed you four times

90
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:37,524
Asking you to come to my desk.

91
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,559
Honey, if I don't have
time to answer an email,

92
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,063
I definitely don't have time
to walk over to your desk.

93
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,264
Wow wowie wowie.

94
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:49,034
Congratulations. It's a big check.

95
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:51,605
Oh, sorry, o-one second.
- Stop sexting pam.

96
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:53,774
I'm trying to congratulate you.

97
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:56,977
This is actually a big
potential sale, so...

98
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:58,845
You writing your memoirs over there?

99
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:00,080
You writing your name over there?

100
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,348
Well, it's a pretty big check.

101
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:02,916
It's good, you know, with the kid.

102
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:05,519
Okay. Don't gloat.
Here's the thing.

103
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:07,688
This kind of money can corrupt people.

104
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,956
All right, here we go. Michael...

105
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:12,946
I'm just saying that--
- michael...

106
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:16,229
Great.

107
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,464
Teddy, nice.

108
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:19,099
Let me just write that down real quick.

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,934
pencil.

110
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:23,369
Get me a pencil.

111
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:24,771
H-hang on, teddy.

112
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:26,740
I'm making a sale. - Mm-hmm.

113
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,874
Sales.
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:31,144
There's other pencils in this office.

115
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,244
Gimme--I--

116
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:47,074
Honey and jelly sandwich time.

117
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:48,161
Mike--
- oh...

118
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:51,030
You gotta be kidding me.

119
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:53,200
Look at that--that's-
I know who did that.

120
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,536
You saw who did this,
and you didn't stop 'em?

121
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,705
Didn't have to see.
It was sales--I can feel it.

122
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:01,340
They are out of control.

123
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,677
The sales department smashed my sandwich.

124
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:06,078
Yes. All of 'em. Together.

125
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:09,515
It's a conspiracy.
Listen to me, mike.

126
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,551
You gotta do something about them.

127
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,686
You don't get it.

128
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:15,554
You need to get back on top.

129
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:17,723
That's what she said.

130
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,259
Yeah.
- Yeah.

131
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:22,963
Something came for you, michael.

132
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:24,564
Thank you very much.

133
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:26,533
What'd you get?

134
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:27,801
Ah. It's just the stupid leads.

135
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,002
All right!
- Oh, about time.

136
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:30,203
Yeah! Me likey!

137
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:31,505
Yeah, finally, michael.

138
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:33,739
Hand 'em over, numb nuts.

139
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:37,144
But seriously, I mean,
it's your job to give us those leads.

140
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:39,712
All right.

141
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,047
Then I guess I should give them out.

142
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,949
Hold on.

143
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:45,752
You know what I'm thinkin'?

144
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:48,388
I'm thinking that I have
something that you want.

145
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:50,824
You guys are acting
like you own this place,

146
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,192
And you don't.

147
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:54,194
Not even sabre owns this place.
It's a rental.

148
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:56,763
I'm kinda sick of the
attitude around here.

149
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,198
I'm sick of the cocky walk.

150
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:03,170
I am sick of you throwing
your paycheck in my face.

151
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,139
I am sick of your uppity attitude...Jim.

152
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:10,910
I think I am not going
to give these to you.

153
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:12,779
Yeah!

154
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,347
We need those leads, michael.

155
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:15,949
That's our job, michael.

156
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:18,183
Michael!

157
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:21,474
Michael, we spent a lot
of money on those leads.

158
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:22,741
You have to give 'em out.

159
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,910
Then we are just rewarding
their bad behavior.

160
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,812
Okay, just imagine...

161
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,683
That instead of going to
jail for murdering someone,

162
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,752
You got an ice cream cone.

163
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,788
If that were the case,
then in the summertime,

164
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:40,691
Everyone would go around killing people

165
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,562
For--for the pleasure
of an ice cream cone.

166
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:44,963
Michael, I don't want...

167
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:46,798
To 'incentivize' murder.

168
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,967
But we've tried to make it clear

169
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,136
That our policy emphasizes sales staff--

170
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,605
They act like I have no power.

171
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,307
But you do. You are in charge...

172
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,376
Thank you.
- Of supporting the sales staff.

173
00:06:57,476 --> 00:07:00,145
You are required to hand
out those leads, michael.

174
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:02,447
Hmm. Well, if that is
what I am required to do,

175
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,815
I will do exactly that.

176
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,984
Okay, good.
- Exactly that.

177
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,886
Good.
- Exactly that.

178
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:10,281
Why do you keep repeating--

179
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:13,190
Hello.

180
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:14,526
May I have everyone's attention, please?

181
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:16,962
Gabe has instructed me
to hand out the leads.

182
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,866
So I am going to give the
leads to...King creed.

183
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,467
What--
- what are you--

184
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,902
And to king...Meredith!

185
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,371
They aren't sales people.

186
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:28,539
And to king angela.

187
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:30,509
Because today we are all kings.

188
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:32,144
And queens.

189
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,813
What the hell do you think you're doing?

190
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,888
I am giving them the leads,
phyllis.

191
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,687
Hey.
- Hey.

192
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,657
So I'm gonna go ahead
and save you some time

193
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,360
And tell you that no one's
gonna go along with this.

194
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,828
But you knew that, right?

195
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,630
Mm-hmm.
- All right.

196
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:54,800
So why don't you just give
me my share of the leads,

197
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,202
And I'll start making some calls?

198
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,403
Okay.

199
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:03,474
Hey, all right.

200
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,843
All right.

201
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:09,056
Ah. These aren't leads.
What are they?

202
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,216
Oh, right. Those are clues.

203
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,785
And within each clue is a lesson.

204
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,188
You learn a lesson,
and then you find a lead.

205
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,624
The leads are scattered all
over the industrial park.

206
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:22,627
I'm trying to make your kids respect you.

207
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,630
Because a father needs
to respect his boss,

208
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,632
And kids don't respect the father

209
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,034
Who doesn't respect the boss.

210
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,569
Do you understand that line of logic?

211
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,204
I don't even think you understand it.

212
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,304
I do understand it.

213
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,141
This one's a map.

214
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,241
Or is it?

215
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:43,447
Oh, how the tables have turned.

216
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,616
I see you got my email.

217
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:48,086
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?

218
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:50,188
I'll give you the leads...

219
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:51,923
But you know what?

220
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:54,693
It's gonna cost you some clerical work.

221
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,628
What are these for?
- It doesn't matter.

222
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:59,023
Fill them out. All of them.

223
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,966
And when you're done,
you can watch me shred them.

224
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:02,801
Right...

225
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,336
I want to watch the kardashians,
okay?

226
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:05,670
I don't want to watch- it's mindless!

227
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,172
The kardashians is a good show.

228
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:08,740
Thank you, stanley!
- No, you don't even know!

229
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,242
How would he even know the kardashians?

230
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,676
It's about a family,
a real-life family.

231
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:12,711
No, stanley, do you--

232
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:13,879
Hey, baby, what's up?

233
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:16,915
I am currently reading incoherent riddles

234
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,584
On blue index cards to
find vital information

235
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,387
That michael has hidden
all over the office.

236
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:24,222
How are you?

237
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:26,992
Uh, nothing but vomit
and diapers over here.

238
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:29,427
Oh, my god.
I couldn't envy you more.

239
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,963
Having a baby is as
exhausting as they say it is.

240
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:34,265
Having two babies...

241
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,134
That's just unfair.

242
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,869
How 'bout this one?

243
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:40,238
'when arrogant salesmen
are mean to my face,

244
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:43,341
A certain manager will
go to his moppy place.'

245
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:46,311
He means his mopey place.
It's under that street lamp

246
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,913
That he thinks was in casablanca.

247
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,281
God, I love you.

248
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,583
Today I turned an office crisis

249
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,318
Into a teachable moment.

250
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:58,289
A lesser manager would have
screwed this day up royally.

251
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:01,259
I can imagine some yokel
sitting behind his desk,

252
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,663
Saying, 'oh, yeah, take a lead.
We're nothing.'

253
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:08,248
Some people shouldn't
be in this business.

254
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:10,635
Hey.

255
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,137
I guess you probably
won't give me your leads

256
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,471
Since I'm a jerk salesman.

257
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,408
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead.

258
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,476
I hid the leads. where?

259
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:30,087
Colder.

260
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:32,556
Cold...Er.

261
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,094
Warmer.

262
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:39,196
Warmer.

263
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,799
Colder.

264
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:41,800
Colder. C--

265
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,034
Warmer.

266
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,336
Warmer.

267
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:46,471
Warmer...

268
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:49,239
Hot! Hotter...

269
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:51,142
Burning hot!

270
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:52,711
Lower...

271
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,312
Are you--
- lower...

272
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:55,881
Are you sure?

273
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:58,849
Low...Er...

274
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,224
What are you doing, idiot?

275
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:08,159
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.

276
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,263
Scavenger hunt? Here.
I can solve it. Give it.

277
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:13,565
'the treasure you seek
is in the parking lot

278
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,333
Under the first president'?

279
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,433
Lincoln.

280
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:21,740
The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.

281
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,441
It involves you too.

282
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,541
The leads are in?!

283
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,579
Michael?

284
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,681
Michael, you were supposed to tell me

285
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:30,916
When the leads came in.

286
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:35,352
Well, big shot,
if you want to find your leads,

287
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,555
Go to the man who never breeds.

288
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,524
kevin.

289
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,092
Damn it!

290
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:44,129
Kevin! Give me those leads.
Where are they--come on!

291
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:46,264
You are never going to find them.

292
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:48,266
Really?
- I'm going to enjoy this.

293
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,235
Gimme the leads!
Where are the leads?

294
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,704
Gimme the leads!
I'm still enjoying it!

295
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:55,407
Where are they?
- They're in the trash.

296
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,242
They're in the trash.

297
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,810
the trash. It's code.

298
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:02,314
All right, meredith.
Take off your dress.

299
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:04,215
Okey-dokey.

300
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:06,451
No. Dear god, no.
It's in the trash can.

301
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:10,821
In the kitchen.
It's coming off either way.

302
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:21,064
Clean sack.

303
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:23,401
Oh...What--
- I emptied it in the dumpster.

304
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:26,804
It had toby's baba ganoush.

305
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,772
If we don't patronize

306
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,607
The only syrian restaurant in town,

307
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,776
There'll be nothing left but pan pizzas

308
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:36,747
And, you know...
Make your own salads.

309
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,320
It's empty!

310
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,856
Wait. What day is today?
- Um...

311
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:47,092
Tonight is ghost whisperer...
So Friday.

312
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:49,326
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

313
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,663
Oh, my god! No, no, no!

314
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,366
Hey, hey!

315
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,466
Wait!

316
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:58,468
Wait!

317
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:01,377
Okay, you know what?
Let's just go to the dump,

318
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:02,378
Start looking.

319
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:04,314
Ryan, come on. Shotgun in my car.

320
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:06,182
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?

321
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:08,518
Why? Because I am not going to call sabre

322
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:11,854
And say, 'hi, you know
those very valuable,

323
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:14,257
'expensive leads that you
gave us earlier today?

324
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:16,159
'well, because of a
screw-up by a staff member,

325
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:17,627
They're now in the city dump.'

326
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,929
Not your staff, michael. You.

327
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,464
Well, that's not the
way it's gonna sound.

328
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:23,132
Here's what we'll do.
We'll go to the dump.

329
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:24,300
We'll look around.

330
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,935
Then we'll all go out and get pizza,

331
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,937
Maybe catch a movie,
late-night drink.

332
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,739
Some more pizza, call it a night.

333
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,542
Does it have to be pizza?
Can we go for a falafel?

334
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:34,642
Really?
- I'm not going.

335
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:36,446
You did this, not us.

336
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,647
Okay, no. You encouraged it.

337
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:38,881
You were complicit.

338
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,784
Complicit. You were all ' successories.'

339
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,719
That sounds fun,
mucking around in the dump.

340
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:44,921
I wish I could go.

341
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:48,123
You can.
- I can't. You know that.

342
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,359
Okay, fine, I get it.
I'll just go by myself.

343
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,195
I'll go, michael.

344
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:57,098
'cause you'll just screw it up.

345
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:11,780
This place has gone to hell.

346
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:16,953
You know, dwight, there was a time

347
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:19,322
You'd be pinching yourself
to have the opportunity

348
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:20,890
To look through a dump with me.

349
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,859
Yeah, well,
the acorn becomes the oak.

350
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,195
Yeah. Well, sometimes the
acorn just stays an acorn.

351
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:28,531
If you don't believe me,
look in my gutters.

352
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,800
You're adorable.
You need to go for it.

353
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,702
I'm gonna be like mad
at you if you don't--

354
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:34,802
Yeah, whatever.

355
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:39,842
Whoo. Can't wait for this day to be over.

356
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,911
Why?
- Just all the drama.

357
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,946
What drama?
- Between the...

358
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:48,149
Us and you guys.

359
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:50,553
It's unnecessary,
right? - So unnecessary.

360
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,922
Oh, good. Thank god you said that.

361
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:55,057
If the salesmen weren't acting like

362
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:56,859
Such a bunch of stuck-up losers,

363
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,394
Then this day wouldn't be so bad.

364
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:01,730
Did you ever think of that?

365
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:03,733
I have new baby pictures.

366
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,668
Jim.

367
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:08,504
Don't use your cute baby
to make us like you.

368
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:11,306
She's wearing a onesie.

369
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:13,375
stop it.

370
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:16,946
If we act nice now,

371
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:19,282
Then we're rewarding them
for treating us poorly.

372
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:20,950
Didn't we kind of start it?

373
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,418
I think you're remembering that wrong.

374
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:23,719
Yeah. I don't know about this.

375
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,922
I mean, I think we
should hold our ground.

376
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,190
The company's changed,

377
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,025
And if they don't like it,
they can leave.

378
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,027
I mean, a lot of their work
can be done from india.

379
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,529
Can we at least all agree
that this is uncomfortable

380
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,689
And maybe heading for something bad?

381
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,601
All those who agree say aye.

382
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:40,303
Aye. - Aye.

383
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,604
All those opposed?
- I don't think we need opposed.

384
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:44,306
You've changed, man.

385
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:47,577
Oh, why, 'cause I have a
shot at a 100k commission?

386
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:49,212
When do you care about money?

387
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:52,148
When I first met you,
you were a wide-eyed innocent.

388
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:54,784
Hey, there is nothing I can
do about my wide-set eyes.

389
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:57,220
No, no, no, I'm talking about
your personality, dwight!

390
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,223
Okay, when I first met you,
I had a lot of job offers.

391
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:03,758
And I had an offer from ivan schotsky--

392
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,061
The ivan schotsky.

393
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:06,796
And if I had assistant-managed him--

394
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:08,397
Assisted to the managed him.

395
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:09,665
Oh, that's low!

396
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:12,034
I would be number two
right now at a home depot!

397
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:13,135
Yeah.
- Okay?!

398
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:14,770
'cause they promote from within!

399
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,006
Instead, I had to follow you.
You're going nowhere.

400
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,842
You think you would have
done better without me.

401
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,143
Really? - I hitched my wagon

402
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:23,311
To a horse with no legs.

403
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,714
Wow! okay!

404
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:28,116
Man!

405
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:30,920
When I think about all
the time that I wasted

406
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,488
Being your friend...

407
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:34,457
I shouldn't have been hanging out

408
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:36,325
Watching karate movies with you!

409
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:37,760
Kung fu movies!

410
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,462
I--you know what I
should have been doing?

411
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:41,430
I should have been out at
bars finding my soul mate,

412
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,266
Finding my wife, making babies.

413
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:46,302
Nice babies you're making
with the floozies at the bars!

414
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:48,170
That's my wife you're talking about, man!

415
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,330
Your made-up wife who doesn't exist?

416
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:53,976
You watch it!

417
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:55,611
If I'd wanted to hit you,
I would have hit you.

418
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:57,480
Don't do it!

419
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,948
No, no.

420
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:02,958
You just made an enemy
with the wrong guy, boy.

421
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:10,131
Wait--time out, time out, time out!

422
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:14,729
Time in. - No!

423
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:19,073
Don't--don't even think about that.

424
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:25,875
Stop it!

425
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:29,177
Give it-- that's my spool!

426
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,580
What's the least we can
do to make this okay?

427
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,250
I'll text pam. She's
really good at this stuff.

428
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,484
Yeah. I'll text erin.

429
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:37,720
She's really good at this stuff too.

430
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,856
I guess we could give them
some of our new commissions.

431
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:42,625
That is a dangerous precedent.

432
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,960
Pam texted back saying we
could give them all ipods.

433
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,629
Uh, if they don't have an ipod by now,

434
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:48,631
They really don't want one.

435
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:51,133
All right. Then we're back to cash.

436
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:52,535
And I gotta say...

437
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,704
If giving a small percentage
of our commissions

438
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:56,639
Is gonna smooth all this over,
I'm for it.

439
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,908
Okay, fine, cash it is.
- Oh.

440
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,576
Erin just texted me back.

441
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:04,161
'people love shells
from faraway beaches.'

442
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:07,149
Okay, dwight. All right, dwight.

443
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,651
Here we go! Here we go!

444
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,287
Oh, god!

445
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:13,588
Oh...

446
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,990
Oh...

447
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:20,829
Oh...

448
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,839
We're never gonna find
those leads, are we?

449
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:31,939
Nah.

450
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,883
Wow.

451
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,619
Amazing, isn't it?

452
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:47,323
No other animal on earth could do this.

453
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,326
Maybe beavers... But not like this.

454
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,866
So how 'bout, guys,
1% commission a month

455
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,000
Instead of 2?

456
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,602
What do you-- - no, no, we agreed.

457
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:01,270
2% for the quarter. - Yes.

458
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,405
Okay.

459
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,973
Hey, everybody.

460
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,107
Nice spread.

461
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,476
We get it-- you eat like royalty.

462
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:09,979
No, no. This is a
representation of how we feel.

463
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,448
And how we feel is really sorry.

464
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:15,151
Yeah. We wanted to bring you
in and make a peace offering.

465
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:18,920
Yeah, we wanted to do
the right thing, so...

466
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:20,222
Way to go, guys.

467
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:21,457
This--this--

468
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,626
This was an integrity move.

469
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,628
Yeah. When we walked in here,

470
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:28,798
We were all prepared to
tell you to go to hell.

471
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:31,167
Do you have any pastries without fruit?

472
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,535
Yes, we do. Eclairs.

473
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:35,171
Ooh.
- Ooh!

474
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:38,274
Well, you better be happy,
taking 2% of our--...

475
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:40,509
...2% milk! What I forgot for the coffee.

476
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:42,011
Yeah, treats, stanley.
They've accepted

477
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:44,580
Our simple offer of treats only,
nothing more.

478
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,948
Oh.

479
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,617
This is nice.

480
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:52,020
All of us back together.

481
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,990
This...Why would somebody throw that out?

482
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,859
Pfft! Waste.

483
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,964
Hey.

484
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:04,467
You know who'd like this? Phyllis.

485
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:07,302
Purple much? - Yeah, she does.

486
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:09,370
She loves purple.

487
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:13,141
Does it stink? - Yeah.

488
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,110
Know what would be a great picture here?

489
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,812
Hmm?
- Just this whole dump,

490
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:19,547
And in the middle, one flower.

491
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:21,849
Mm-hmm.
- That's it.

492
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,285
Wow.

493
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:25,850
And the caption would read...

494
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:27,623
Hope...

495
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,724
Grows...

496
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:33,494
In a dump.

497
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:37,633
Whoo-hoo!

498
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,735
The good news that you found our leads?

499
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:41,637
No. Better.
- We have an awesome

500
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,739
Beanbag chair that's
perfect for the break room.

501
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,175
Eech! I'm never gonna sit
on that disgusting seat.

502
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,443
Yeah, damn right, you're not,

503
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:48,911
'cause it's for me and michael only!

504
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:52,947
Yeah!

505
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,805
It's freezing out here.

506
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:59,173
Yeah!

507
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,442
Well, I...

508
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,311
I have warm blood.

509
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:05,147
Uh...Oh, wow.

510
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,247
Oh, thank you.

511
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,667
You're the nicest person I've ever met.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
