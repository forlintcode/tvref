1
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:06,325
Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:07,626
Merry Christ... No!

3
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:09,728
Why are you...
why did you bring that here?

4
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:11,868
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh, wait...

5
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:13,904
He's dead.

6
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:15,158
Dwight, what...

7
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:19,249
I accidentally ran over it.
It's a Christmas miracle.

8
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:20,446
Get it out of here!

9
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:21,549
Relax, okay?

10
00:00:21,678 --> 00:00:23,360
And because this is Christmas,

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,924
I am going to roast this
goose and prepare it

12
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:28,481
with a wild rice dressing.

13
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:31,104
Do we have any
cayenne pepper in the kitchen?

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,993
Merry Christmas, Dwight.

15
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:35,390
What have we got here?

16
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:36,552
What does it look like?

17
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:38,222
Dead goose.

18
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:39,612
And circle gets the square.

19
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:40,640
All right.

20
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:43,932
So can you watch this? I'm gonna
get my carving knife out of the trunk.

21
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:45,260
Dwight, we talked about this.

22
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:46,923
No, Toby, this is different.

23
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,470
He is already dead.

24
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:51,531
Once, I brought in a duck
to prepare for lunch.

25
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:53,901
And people got upset.

26
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:58,830
Apparently, they go attached to the duck
and didn't want to see it killed.

27
00:00:58,887 --> 00:00:59,991
He was already dead.

28
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,551
And we Schrutes
use every part of the goose.

29
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:05,631
The meat has a delicious,
smoky, rich flavor.

30
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:08,983
Plus, you can use the molten goose
grease and save it in the refrigerator.

31
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:12,311
Thus saving you a trip to the store
for a can of expensive goose grease.

32
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:13,480
Oh, win-win.

33
00:01:13,798 --> 00:01:15,193
- Exactly.
- Thank you, Jim.

34
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:16,870
I like goose and it's already dead.

35
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:18,273
Is it so crazy if we eat it?

36
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:20,002
That's crazy. It's crazy.

37
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,502
Dwight, you cannot keep that here.

38
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:23,880
Okay, that is ridiculous.

39
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:26,302
and totally against
the spirit of Christmas.

40
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:28,283
Come on, Dwight.

41
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:31,341
We went over this,
like, for a half an hour.

42
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:33,212
It's Christmas, Toby.

43
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,211
It's a dead animal in our office,

44
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:37,630
- you can't...
- Toby...

45
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:38,701
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:41,051
Please?

47
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:42,843
Please?

48
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:48,031
Clean it in your car.

49
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:50,933
I would like it off my desk.

50
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:53,680
Oh, Pam... Take a chill pill.

51
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:18,493
The catch 22 team vous présente...

52
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:21,350
Episode 10 et 11 Saison 3
"A Benihana Christmas "


53
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,323
http://www.theofficeus.fr/
http://www.forom.com/

54
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,061
Hey!

55
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:40,183
I would like

56
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:41,891
a nice slice

57
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,603
of Christmas Pam.

58
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:45,052
Side of candy Pams.

59
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:46,852
And perhaps...

60
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,221
some Pam chops.

61
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:51,240
- Can I help you, Michael?
- With mint.

62
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:53,751
I'm looking for the toy drive box.

63
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:55,830
- It's behind you.
- Okay.

64
00:02:55,898 --> 00:02:58,901
Well, I need to put this bike in there.

65
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:02,093
I hope it'll fit
with all these little knickknacks.

66
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:04,771
What kind of bike is that?

67
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:06,323
Um, I don't know.

68
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:07,612
Average kind.

69
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:09,381
The tires look pretty worn.

70
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:11,882
Well, that is probably
from the test drive.

71
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,331
But the paint's chipping.

72
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:15,103
Is that your old bike, Michael?

73
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:18,050
Yo, Michael. Sweet ride, Mike.

74
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,090
Oh, thanks.

75
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:23,272
- Michael...
- Yes?

76
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,133
Oh, Pam.

77
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:27,580
That is so sweet.

78
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:28,871
You didn't have to do that.

79
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:30,482
I didn't. It's from corporate.

80
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:31,962
Okay.

81
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:33,632
- Did everybody get one of these?
- Yep.

82
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:35,421
Terrific. Good!

83
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:37,930
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

84
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,900
My girlfriend Carol
is coming to our party tonight.

85
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,183
And I have a little surprise for her.

86
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:45,253
I've got

87
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:48,563
two tickets to paradise

88
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,790
Pack your bags,
we're leaving day after tomorrow

89
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:54,882
Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica.

90
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:55,811
All-inclusive.

91
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,650
All-inclusive.

92
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,511
You know what that means.

93
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:01,002
Right?

94
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:02,313
Yeah. 

95
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,442
Oh, I think you're supposed
to put a toy in the box, Creed.

96
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,163
And a happy holiday to you.

97
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,391
- Carol.
- Hi, is Michael around here?

98
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:24,661
There she is!

99
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,503
A Christmas Carol.

100
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:27,541
Hello.

101
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,122
You're about
five hours early to the party.

102
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,141
Oh, you're such a blonde.

103
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:35,891
Hey, everybody!

104
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:38,960
I  don't know who you haven't met yet,

105
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:40,821
but I think this is one of them.

106
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,752
This  is my girlfriend, Carol.

107
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,651
This is just the front of her.

108
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,651
Show 'em... show 'em the other side.

109
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,880
- What?
- Turn around. Turn around.

110
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:49,942
Come on.

111
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:52,573
- Get out of here.
- Oh, you get out of here.

112
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,322
- Yes?
- If I may say,

113
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:56,993
she's even prettier
than you described her.

114
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,572
Oh, ouch!

115
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:02,311
Michael, I don't think there's anything
wrong with the way you described her.

116
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:04,663
- Thank you.
- I really need a moment alone with you.

117
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:07,762
Not as much as I need
a moment alone with you.

118
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:13,101
What is this?

119
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:15,660
That is my Christmas card.

120
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:19,843
It's a picture of you and me and
your kids on a ski trip, having a blast.

121
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:21,222
"Ski-son's Greetings."

122
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:22,502
No, see...

123
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:24,242
We never went on a ski trip.

124
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,203
I know, I know.

125
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:26,923
- I went on a ski trip...
- Right.

126
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,432
... two years ago,
with my kids and my ex-husband.

127
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:32,171
Yes, but what you didn't realize
at the time was

128
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:35,612
that I was with you, in a sense.
I was in your heart

129
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:38,112
- Michael...
- and next to your kids. What?

130
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:40,412
This is so weird.

131
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:42,121
I don't understand.

132
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:46,202
It's a bold move to Photoshop yourself
into a picture with your girlfriend

133
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:49,103
and her kids on a ski trip
with their real father.

134
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:51,940
But then again, Michael's a bold guy.

135
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,123
Is bold the right word?

136
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:55,983
I think you're a really sweet guy.

137
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,810
- Okay.
- But, um...

138
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:00,191
I don't know how to deal with...

139
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,020
with, like this... thing.

140
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:04,050
And... and the proposal.

141
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,901
And I don't think things
are gonna work out with us.

142
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:08,321
No, no. Okay, okay.

143
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,560
You know what?
You're not thinking straight.

144
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,854
You know what you need?

145
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,221
You need...

146
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:15,314
to think this through in...

147
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,950
Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.

148
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,173
What are you talking about?

149
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:23,890
I got us tickets...

150
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:27,602
to Sandals, Jamaica.
We leave day after tomorrow.

151
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:30,610
You had better find the skimpiest bikini

152
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,122
- there is.
- Michael...

153
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:34,450
And it's all-inclusive.

154
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:36,801
Yes?

155
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:38,423
I'm sorry.

156
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:43,422
No, Carol.
You walk out that door, and it is over.

157
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:44,692
I know.

158
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,540
Jim?

159
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:03,180
- Um, hey.
- Hey.

160
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,710
I need to give you
your Christmas gift now.

161
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:07,063
Because, um...

162
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,240
Well, I'll just tell you.

163
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,331
What?

164
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:12,210
For the past few months,

165
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:15,762
I've been sending Dwight
letters from the CIA.

166
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:20,271
Are you serious?

167
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:23,021
They're considering him
for a top-secret mission.

168
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:24,813
There's his application.

169
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,432
And this is where I made him list

170
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:29,340
every secret he promised
he'd never, ever tell.

171
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,853
"Last year, my boss, Michael Scott,

172
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,333
"took a day off,
'cause he said he had pneumonia,

173
00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:38,261
"but really, he was leaving early
to go to magic camp."

174
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:41,122
So here's the gift.

175
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:44,343
You get to decide
what his top secret mission is.

176
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:46,762
Sorry I didn't wrap it.

177
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,611
You know what?

178
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:56,230
I really don't think I should be doing
this stuff anymore, though.

179
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,300
Oh.

180
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:59,403
- Just 'cause of the promotion.
- Oh, yeah.

181
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,111
Just feels a little bit like, uh...

182
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,241
No, I get it.

183
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:03,673
Of course.

184
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:05,533
Okay.

185
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:06,561
Oh.

186
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:18,660
I feel like there's a chance
for me to start over.

187
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:22,901
And... if I fall back into the same kind
of things I used to do, then...

188
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:25,450
What am I doing?

189
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:32,463
I'd  like everybody's attention.

190
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:34,953
Christmas is canceled.

191
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:36,710
You can't cancel a holiday.

192
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,882
Keep it up, Stanley,
and you will lose New Year's.

193
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,930
What does that mean?

194
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,911
Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley!

195
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,710
Michael, what's going on?

196
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,000
Carol and I...

197
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:51,590
split up.

198
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,481
Amicably.

199
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,592
And I just don't think
it would be appropriate

200
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:58,302
to celebrate under the circumst...

201
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:00,242
Will they still air Rudolph?

202
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:01,410
That's not fair. 

203
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,830
Are we going to cancel Hanukkah as well?

204
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:06,701
Fine!

205
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:08,561
Have your party!

206
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:10,200
Just no guests.

207
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:11,943
But we invited guests.

208
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:13,971
Well, you know what, Phyllis?

209
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:16,710
All of your guests

210
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:20,141
would have probably canceled
at the last minute anyway.

211
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,900
Leaving  your life a stupid, rotten mess.

212
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:26,043
Okay.

213
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,333
It hurts.

214
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:37,813
I know.

215
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:40,230
It hurts my heart.

216
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,092
It hurts my stomach.

217
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:45,933
Hurts my arms.

218
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:49,323
Okay, well,
why are you laying like that?

219
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:50,583
Thanks.

220
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:53,743
How did you push away the bad thoughts?

221
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:54,843
Like what?

222
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,263
Like maybe

223
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,260
the real reason they left

224
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:00,451
was because...

225
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:01,933
there were things

226
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,303
they wanted you to do

227
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:05,743
in bed

228
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:06,991
that were...

229
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:08,390
Wha... um...

230
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:09,701
foreign and scary.

231
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,171
I--I don't believe

232
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:13,081
And not that you didn't wanna try them.

233
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,172
Some wine might have helped.

234
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,233
Do you know what I'm referring to?

235
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,400
I don't need to know.

236
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:19,941
- Michael?
- Yep?

237
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:21,053
Sorry to interrupt.

238
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:23,280
It appears we're one bathrobe be short.

239
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:25,460
Take it from Toby.

240
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:26,571
Copy.

241
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:30,632
Pam, would you like to go
to Sandals, Jamaica with me?

242
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:32,702
- No, thank you.
- It's all... Okay.

243
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,370
Hey, Dwight.

244
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:38,103
Some pretty nice robes there.

245
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:40,612
Why?

246
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:44,853
Phyllis, I need you to pick up
green streamers at lunch.

247
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,261
I thought you said green was whorish.

248
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,052
No, orange is whorish.

249
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:54,552
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas

250
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:57,240
to make the Stamford people
feel more at home.

251
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,230
Each year, we have a Christmas raffle.

252
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,190
- Okay.
- It would never work here.

253
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,161
Okay...

254
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:06,781
Um, another idea was

255
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:08,172
- karaoke.
- No.

256
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,420
A Christmas drinking game.

257
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,293
- Yes.
- God help you.

258
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:14,923
What?

259
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:16,943
These are all terrible ideas.

260
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:20,512
And none of them are on the theme
of a Nutcracker Christmas.

261
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:22,760
I think you should leave.

262
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:25,243
You're kidding.

263
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:26,480
You tried this out

264
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,323
and it's clearly not for you.

265
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:29,723
It's time to go.

266
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:33,963
Come  on!

267
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,003
Please? Thank you.

268
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,402
Okay.

269
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:40,700
Thank you very much.

270
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,150
- What are you doing?
- We are getting rid of everything

271
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:56,122
that reminds you of Carol.

272
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:57,591
Hey, what's a-haps?

273
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:00,551
Carol?

274
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:01,751
No.

275
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:03,491
Oh, look at this.

276
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:07,152
Your old condo closing papers.

277
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:09,182
It's riddled with Carol's name.

278
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:11,350
I wish I could throw this in the box.

279
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,482
Why don't you just buy the whole song?

280
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:24,432
I don't have to buy it.

281
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:26,841
I just wanna taste it.

282
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,051
That's all.

283
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,191
I just want a little taste of it.

284
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,900
Oh, look at this. She saved you $2,000

285
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:38,530
'cause they failed
to report a mold problem.

286
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:41,790
But wouldn't that affect the final...

287
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:42,992
How did she...

288
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,633
Oh...oh, I see what she did.

289
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:46,740
That is good.

290
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,722
That Carol is one smart cookie.

291
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,350
This is an old adage,

292
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:13,061
but they say
that when you find true love,

293
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:16,632
you know within the first 24 hours.

294
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,033
With Carol?

295
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:23,853
I knew within the first 24 minutes
of the second day I met her.

296
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:37,670
I feel like
I've been kind of cold to Karen.

297
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,443
And there's no real reason for it.

298
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,373
I mean, it's not like
she's ever done anything to me.

299
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,630
So... I think I probably
shouldn't be cold to her.

300
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,570
Hey... Karen...

301
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:50,961
Sorry about that meeting today.
That was really crazy.

302
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,271
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that.

303
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:55,811
Because I don't know
how those meetings usually go.

304
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:57,093
Um, usually like that.

305
00:13:57,926 --> 00:13:59,850
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela?

306
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,531
I think one of her cats did once.

307
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,880
She came in
with scratches all over her face.

308
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,043
Right.

309
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:08,930
Um...I really liked your karaoke idea.

310
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:11,060
- Oh, cool, yeah.
- That could really be fun.

311
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:12,451
You guys do a raffle?

312
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:13,681
Yeah, we do a raffle.

313
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:19,982
- Hey, Kev.
- Hey.

314
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,151
This should have been up yesterday.

315
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,343
It'll be all right.

316
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:40,760
What is that?

317
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:45,092
"The Committee to Plan Parties invites
you to a Margarita-Karaoke Christmas."

318
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:47,373
There's no such thing
as the Committee to Plan Parties.

319
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:48,930
There is now. We just started it.

320
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,891
Well, you can't just start a committee.

321
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:52,191
You have to have funding.

322
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:53,222
What's your funding?

323
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,381
$200.

324
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:56,800
- What's ours again?
- Um, $201.

325
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:58,111
- Right.
- Hey!

326
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:01,471
A Margarita-Karaoke Christmas party. 
That sounds like fun.

327
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:02,983
No, that is not a party.

328
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:06,231
There's only one party, and it's hosted
by the party planning committee,

329
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:07,442
and it starts at 3:00.

330
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:09,263
Then why are there two flyers?

331
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:12,851
I understand that this is confusing
for everyone. Let me explain.

332
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:15,382
- There's a party that starts at 3:00.
- Right.

333
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,613
And then there's a way more fun
party that starts at 2:45.

334
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:21,761
Right,  and if you're interested
in the way more fun party,

335
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:25,183
all the info can be found here
on our more brightly-colored flyer.

336
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,203
I didn't see where it was.

337
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,420
Yep, looks like the Scranton people
and the Stamford people are

338
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:39,842
finally coming together.

339
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,503
And that's what you want, right?

340
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:45,911
I think that's a really good...

341
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:46,950
Pam and Karen!

342
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:51,020
I am ordering you to cease and desist
all party planning immediately.

343
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:54,071
- You can't do that.
- As ranking N°3 in this office...

344
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:56,373
- I'm N°3.
- You're N°4.

345
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:58,001
- Yeah, but I'm N°3.
- Uh, no.

346
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,341
You must turn over to me
all Christmas decorations

347
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,873
and party paraphernalia
immediately that'll be returned to you

348
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:03,743
on January 4th.

349
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,711
- Okay, I think I can help here.
- Okay, good.

350
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,943
As ranking number two,
I am starting a committee

351
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:10,262
to determine
the validity of the two committees.

352
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:11,583
And I am the sole member.

353
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:13,022
Committee will act on this now.

354
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,543
- This's stupid.
- Can you keep it down? I'm in session.

355
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:20,450
I've determined this committee is valid.

356
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:22,613
What? No, no! Wait, wait.

357
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:24,943
Permission to join
the validity committee.

358
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:28,860
Permission denied.

359
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:29,983
Damn it!

360
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:34,002
Hey.

361
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:37,261
I can't concentrate
when I know you're in pain, man.

362
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:38,702
Let me take you to lunch.

363
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,353
Come on, my treat.

364
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:46,520
All right. Nothing here
to distract myself with anyway.

365
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:47,810
That's my boy.

366
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:50,292
I know the perfect place too.

367
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:51,343
Hooters?

368
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,182
No, Benihana.

369
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:54,392
Much classier.

370
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,220
But don't worry.

371
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:58,263
The babes are totally hot too.

372
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,861
Well, I need my entourage.

373
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:04,521
Jim, Dwight, Ryan.

374
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:06,141
Come on, we're going to Asian Hooters.

375
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:07,180
Oh, man, I can't.

376
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:09,290
- Why not?
- I'm not feeling so well.

377
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,243
I got a ton of work to do here
and MSG allergy, peanut allergy.

378
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,060
I just ate there last night.

379
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,850
- Okay. Feel better.
- Thanks.

380
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:18,163
Come on, Jim. Let's go.

381
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:19,082
Okay.

382
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,710
Wow... thanks for taking
all the excuses, dude.

383
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:25,942
Doctor appointment, car trouble,
plantar warts, granddad fought in WWII.

384
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,763
Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.

385
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:28,882
Look alive, Halpert.

386
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:30,000
Welcome back.

387
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,082
Bros before hoes!

388
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,311
Why? Because your bros
are always there for you.

389
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:36,920
They have got your back

390
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,200
after your ho rips your heart out

391
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,360
for no good reason.

392
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:43,010
And you were nothing
but great to your ho,

393
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:45,980
and you told her
that she was the only ho for you,

394
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:49,320
and that she was better
than all the other hoes in the world.

395
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:50,962
And then...

396
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:57,371
then suddenly, 
she's not your ho no mo'.

397
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:06,901
So... she looks really hot.

398
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:08,470
So I said,

399
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:10,773
"You look hotter than usual today."

400
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:11,830
Thank you.

401
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,591
Michael.

402
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:16,150
Head of the table.

403
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,413
Just get in right there.

404
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,511
Good.

405
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,811
Actually, um...

406
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:23,111
Excuse me, sir,

407
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:26,322
- I'm gonna need to take this chair.
- Dwight, just leav... leave them alone.

408
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:29,130
Please. They're on a date,
they look very happy.

409
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,512
So she looks at me, right?

410
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,450
And she goes,
"I'm sorry, do I even know you?"

411
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:37,611
After a year!

412
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:40,883
A year of buying lattes from her.
Do you believe that?

413
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:41,952
Yes.

414
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:44,280
I can't...
I can't hear what you're saying!

415
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,692
- Carol used to drink lattes.
- Who are you talking about?

416
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:49,520
She would get
this little foam moustache.

417
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,853
- And I used to say, "Hey, got latte?"
- Carol had a moustache?

418
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:54,851
And she'd say, "That's not funny."

419
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:55,973
What're you talking about?

420
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:58,402
She totally got me. She understood...

421
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:02,282
- that we didn't have to laugh
- Michael!

422
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:03,402
to enjoy each other.

423
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:05,353
Repeat what you said, louder.

424
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,773
It is my job to be there for Michael.

425
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:10,963
How can I be here for Michael
if I'm here for Michael?

426
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:18,762
I'm already starting
to forget what color eyes she had.

427
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:21,201
I can't... okay. I'm gonna call her.

428
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,250
- I am going to call and find out...
- No!

429
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,622
Who are you calling?

430
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,671
I'm gonna call her.

431
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,841
Put that away. SOS! We... hi.

432
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:29,970
Mayday.

433
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,781
Man down over here, we need your help.

434
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:34,302
What can I get for ya?

435
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,743
I think we'll start
with a round of Nog-a-sakes.

436
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:40,210
One part eggnog.

437
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,190
Three parts sake!

438
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:45,811
Some places won't make it for you,
though, because eggnog

439
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:47,221
is seasonal.

440
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,843
You should put out salt for the rims.

441
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:53,762
That's a great idea.

442
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:55,701
Phyllis?

443
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:57,472
I was just getting a snack.

444
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,741
You can have your snack in here.

445
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,491
Pam, don't tell her what to do.

446
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:02,650
Phyllis...

447
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:04,201
Oh... okay.

448
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:13,880
I think I'll go to Angela's party
because that's the party I know.

449
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:18,282
I miss the days when there was only
one party I didn't want to go to.

450
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:21,681
So I only use three?

451
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:24,160
If you use more
than three pieces of tape

452
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:25,921
to wrap a present,
you're doing it wrong.

453
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,322
Okay, and where'd
you get all those cool bows?

454
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:31,030
Oh, I just get those
at any party supply place.

455
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:32,940
Okay.

456
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,451
Are you sure I can't use,
like, the cartoons from the newspaper?

457
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,510
Oh, yeah, your mom would love that.

458
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:42,262
- Hey.
- Hey.

459
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:45,042
All right, I'll see you guys later.

460
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:46,183
Bye.

461
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,833
He's cute. You should date him.

462
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,460
Yeah, maybe.

463
00:20:58,027 --> 00:21:01,013
Looks like you got a little nakiri knife
action going there.

464
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:02,132
No, it's usuba.

465
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:05,683
Yeah, I bet
you wish you had a nakiri, though.

466
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:09,600
Actually, the usuba's the better knife
when you're working with this quantity.

467
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:11,040
Eh, I don't know.

468
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:12,760
Still think nakiri's better.

469
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,652
I think he'd know.

470
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,701
Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.

471
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:22,512
Wait for the onion.

472
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:24,142
Trust me.

473
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,133
Hey, Cindy!

474
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:31,562
He just had his heart broken.
You wouldn't do that to him, would you?

475
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:34,180
- I don't know.
- Oh, sure you would. Look at you.

476
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:36,481
I bet you break up
with a guy every hour.

477
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:39,942
You made her laugh!

478
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:41,322
Yes!

479
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,972
She totally digs us.

480
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:44,793
Watch, watch.

481
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:48,860
Huh? Huh?

482
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:50,591
What did I tell you?

483
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:52,561
You're right. That's good.

484
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:58,991
Hello, everyone.

485
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:02,062
We would just like to announce
that our party is starting now

486
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:03,982
in the break room, so...

487
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,610
I have a very
important announcement to make.

488
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:08,270
About...

489
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:10,191
your paychecks.

490
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:15,112
Your paychecks
will be arriving as scheduled on Friday.

491
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,522
And they will be in the correct amount

492
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:20,313
that they normally are in.

493
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,720
Please stand by
for a very important announcement

494
00:22:26,237 --> 00:22:28,381
further regarding your paycheck!

495
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:33,112
I need to know if I can start the party.

496
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,031
Michael!

497
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:37,573
Hey!

498
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:39,240
Over here, Michael!

499
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,451
I don't know. No one can hear me.

500
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,380
You know what? Start the party.

501
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:49,553
Did Michael give you
permission to do this?

502
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,043
Start the party.

503
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:58,002
Also, I would like to inform you that,

504
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:01,491
as a special treat,
my party will be starting early.

505
00:23:01,605 --> 00:23:03,273
In fact, it will be starting...

506
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:04,703
Right now.

507
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:07,102
- Our party is also starting now!
- Yep.

508
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:36,213
- All right, Stanley!
- Good choice.

509
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:41,330
Welcome, Hannah.

510
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:43,151
You will not be disappointed.

511
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,041
Why would I bedisappointed?

512
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:47,120
I said you wouldn't be disappointed.

513
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,333
Meredith, if you don't come to my party,

514
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:54,693
you will be very, very sorry.

515
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:56,533
Is that a threat?

516
00:23:57,807 --> 00:23:59,223
No, it's an invitation.

517
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,070
- We have vodka!
- Lots of it.

518
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:09,981
I hear Angela's party
will have double fudge brownies.

519
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:12,682
But it will also have Angela.

520
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:15,190
So, double fudge.

521
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:17,020
Angela.

522
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:19,381
Double fudge...

523
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:22,451
Angela.

524
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:30,451
Brownies.

525
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:33,102
- Cupcakes.
- Don't push it.

526
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:44,912
Are we taking this too far?

527
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,802
You know what? I don't think
we're taking this far enough.

528
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,021
What?

529
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:52,810
I got goose bumps.

530
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:56,511
I don't back down.

531
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:59,051
My sister and I used to be best friends,

532
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:02,270
and we haven't talked
in 16 years over some disagreement

533
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:03,693
I don't even remember.

534
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:05,062
So...

535
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,861
Yeah.

536
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:08,121
I'm pretty good.

537
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,011
Damn, this chicken is good.

538
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:15,211
My compliments to the chef.

539
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:16,992
Which is you!

540
00:25:17,897 --> 00:25:18,890
Right?

541
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:21,770
Awesome!

542
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,100
I need some meat.

543
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:25,000
I want some steak.

544
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:27,930
That guy's got steak.

545
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,703
I see steak.

546
00:25:29,835 --> 00:25:31,402
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me!

547
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,601
En garde!

548
00:25:34,377 --> 00:25:35,801
It's family style.

549
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:36,910
No, it's not.

550
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,120
Oh, God.

551
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:39,691
Cindy! Cindy!

552
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:40,863
I love steak.

553
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:42,021
I love it!

554
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:45,700
I want you to close your eyes

555
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,203
and imagine your dream house.

556
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:52,532
Come on! Do it for Michael.

557
00:25:52,588 --> 00:25:54,013
He's had a really long day.

558
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,201
What are you doing?

559
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:57,391
This is great.

560
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:58,890
- Jim!
- Okay.

561
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,062
Jim!

562
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:02,143
What...

563
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:04,370
What's happening?

564
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:07,821
She's asleep.

565
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:10,353
Narcolepsy.

566
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:11,460
Probably.

567
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:14,421
Okay, now open your eyes

568
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,181
and describe it to me.

569
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,021
I don't know.

570
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:20,791
It has four bedrooms and a loft.

571
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,962
- Oh, my God! Now she's up.
- Yeah?

572
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:26,213
And she's trying to describe
how to correctly butcher a goose,

573
00:26:26,246 --> 00:26:28,070
but she's having trouble
coming up with it.

574
00:26:28,105 --> 00:26:29,182
Okay. Cindy!

575
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:30,791
Yo, Cindy, Cindy.

576
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:34,932
Hold its neck back,
insert the knife beneath the jaw,

577
00:26:34,977 --> 00:26:36,322
bring it all the way around.

578
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:38,300
There's gonna be a good amount of blood.

579
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,843
Don't let that bother you.
Have a bucket there for the blood and

580
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:43,772
the innards and the feathers.

581
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,602
Oh, no, this is different.

582
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:49,031
The CIA thing,
that was a prank on Dwight.

583
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,472
This is more like a, um...

584
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:55,111
Okay, it's pretty much the same thing.

585
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:11,133
What do you think?

586
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:12,881
Fruity and delicious.

587
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:14,573
See, I told you. You want one, Meredith?

588
00:27:14,606 --> 00:27:15,610
No thanks.

589
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:16,861
They're too sweet.

590
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,012
Hey, so what's the status?

591
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,733
Looks like they forgot the power cord.

592
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:23,190
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

593
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,891
- No.
- Oh, God.

594
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:26,500
You guys, guys.

595
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:29,861
I'm sorry, but there's a problem
with the karaoke machine.

596
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:31,851
That blows.

597
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:33,010
Hang on, little ladies.

598
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:35,762
You don't need this thing.
I'll go grab my synthesizer.

599
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:40,783
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

600
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:48,201
- Hi.
- Hey.

601
00:27:48,995 --> 00:27:51,130
Hey, look when you get done with your...

602
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:53,432
meeting, you should come
to the break room.

603
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:54,601
We're having a party.

604
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:55,990
- Oh, okay.
- All right?

605
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:57,452
See you later.

606
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:04,373
These nuts are really hard to crack.

607
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:06,060
Try harder then.

608
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:14,452
No one has seconds
until everyone's had some.

609
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,621
You've got to be kidding.

610
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:18,461
You've got to be kidding.

611
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:27,323
Cold, huh?

612
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:29,131
Yeah.

613
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,572
That'll help.

614
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,433
Is it cold in there?

615
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:39,380
They have been
checking us out all night.

616
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,671
I am not kidding!

617
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,420
- You know what we should do?
- What?

618
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,481
We should invite them
to the Christmas party.

619
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:45,932
Now you are thinking.

620
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:47,573
Yes!

621
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:48,721
And you know what?

622
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:51,182
Because you have had such a rough day,

623
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:52,551
you get Cindy.

624
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:55,712
Oh, you are such a mensch, my friend.

625
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:03,461
Okay, where is everybody?

626
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:06,713
I would like them
to meet my new girlfriend.

627
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:09,311
I'm sure they'll want to meet her too.

628
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,300
The least I could do

629
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:18,570
was give some poor sick kid a bike.

630
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:19,972
That rocks.

631
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:21,370
Yeah, you rock.

632
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:24,032
Tell you what.
If you want it, it's yours.

633
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:25,902
Thanks!

634
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:29,620
I want to give you something.

635
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:34,683
That's what she said?

636
00:29:36,495 --> 00:29:37,570
Hello!

637
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:40,501
I would like everybody
to meet my new girlfriend.

638
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:42,203
And my new girlfriend.

639
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,713
Where's Dwight?

640
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:45,780
Is he the hot one or the giant baby?

641
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,023
The giant baby.

642
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:49,421
Wow, I am so sorry.

643
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:51,691
I had no idea this party'd be so lame.

644
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:53,542
There's another party in the break room.

645
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:56,490
Oh, party in the break room!
Let's go, let's go. Thank God.

646
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:58,670
- Let's go to the break room.
- Excuse me!

647
00:29:58,707 --> 00:30:00,213
Waitress lady, hey!

648
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:01,981
Where do you think
you're going with that?

649
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:03,211
I thought I could have it.

650
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,340
You can't have it.

651
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:07,030
I don't walk into your house
and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.

652
00:30:07,058 --> 00:30:08,662
Ssshut it!

653
00:30:08,877 --> 00:30:10,101
Come on, party.

654
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:12,152
Hey, it's Angela!

655
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:30,962
I just think that there are two...

656
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:34,152
two specific
kinds of people in the world.

657
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:36,493
People who own houses

658
00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:38,931
and people who own condos.

659
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:40,330
All right?

660
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:42,882
And...

661
00:30:43,438 --> 00:30:44,892
my question to you

662
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:46,773
is do you agree?

663
00:30:47,757 --> 00:30:49,181
Do I agree about what?

664
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:51,112
Do you agree about what?

665
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:57,372
You're lucky you're so damn cute.

666
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:01,022
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

667
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,112
Way to go, Kev.

668
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:25,403
Good work.

669
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:37,512
Did you have fun at Benihana's?

670
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:38,621
No.

671
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:41,282
It was awful. I couldn't hear anything.

672
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,800
I've had the worst day here.

673
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:55,332
Dwight...

674
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:57,632
You won the raffle.

675
00:31:57,768 --> 00:31:58,773
No...

676
00:31:58,957 --> 00:31:59,952
way!

677
00:32:00,407 --> 00:32:02,293
- Yeah!
- Open it, open it!

678
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,860
- Do you like it?
- Walkie-talkies!

679
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,802
- Can I talk to you a sec?
- Yes!

680
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:14,171
Well, the Committee to Plan Parties
has served its purpose.

681
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:15,721
We're gonna disband

682
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,353
in the name of Christmas.

683
00:32:19,277 --> 00:32:21,263
In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.

684
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:25,930
Angela?

685
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:30,023
We've been hearing really great things
about your brownies and

686
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,193
we were hoping you'd
consider merging the two parties.

687
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:35,033
I'm not sure.

688
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,960
Does your karaoke machine
have Christmas songs?

689
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:43,770
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.

690
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:47,482
I may have seen it somewhere.

691
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:54,643
Is it this one?

692
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,612
Yeah.

693
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:57,663
Thanks.

694
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,052
We'll go tell everyone.

695
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,201
Okay.

696
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:02,332
When you know, you just know.

697
00:34:03,147 --> 00:34:04,142
Right?

698
00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:05,952
- Right.
- Check her out.

699
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,913
My little gal over there?
Babe-a-lectable.

700
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,082
Which one is she?

701
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:15,491
It's one of those two.

702
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:17,870
You don't know?

703
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:19,543
Dude, you should know.

704
00:34:19,898 --> 00:34:20,891
Yeah, well...

705
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:24,300
It's been hard, they're wearing
the exact same uniform.

706
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:25,972
And I've been drinking.

707
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,681
And

708
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:29,192
you know how all...

709
00:34:29,788 --> 00:34:31,102
waitresses look alike.

710
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:36,592
I honestly don't see
what the big deal is.

711
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,342
Stevie Wonder is married.

712
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:39,901
Are you going to tell me...

713
00:34:40,605 --> 00:34:43,171
that Steve Wonder doesn't love his wife

714
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:45,851
just because he's not 
sure what she looks like?

715
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:47,110
Hey!

716
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:49,533
Where's my girl?

717
00:34:51,737 --> 00:34:53,272
Is she in the fridge?

718
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:55,540
Where is she hiding?

719
00:34:56,337 --> 00:34:58,272
I don't know where she is.

720
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,460
Oh, 'cause I'm drunk.

721
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:02,833
I can't ever find her.

722
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:06,262
You know where I am.

723
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,360
I do!

724
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:08,872
Hi!

725
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:11,080
I just haven't hugged you in a while.

726
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,262
Good. That felt good.

727
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:17,402
Let's go party.

728
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:46,490
Monkey, this is Possum.

729
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:47,640
Do you copy?

730
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:48,790
Copy, Possum.

731
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:49,892
What's your 20?

732
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:52,343
No way!

733
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:55,103
What a horrible,
horrible movie that was.

734
00:35:55,245 --> 00:35:57,010
And now I get to remember it forever.

735
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,603
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

736
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:05,603
- Hey.
- Hey.

737
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:07,022
Hey you!

738
00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:08,392
How are you?

739
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:11,611
This party blows, so we're gonna leave.

740
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:12,981
No, no.

741
00:36:13,058 --> 00:36:16,053
Hey, you should stay
because we're having fun.

742
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,121
And...

743
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,061
Where do you wanna go?

744
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:21,223
I... we're just gonna take off.

745
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:23,713
You know what? I...

746
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:24,750
Okay, listen.

747
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:26,330
I like you.

748
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,122
I really like you.

749
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:32,272
So much, in fact,
that I would like you to accompany me

750
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:34,850
on a trip to Sandals Jamaica.

751
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:39,660
No, I have school.

752
00:36:47,928 --> 00:36:48,952
You want help?

753
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,102
Okay.

754
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,333
Merry Christmas!

755
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:52,773
Merry Christmas.

756
00:37:17,728 --> 00:37:20,231
That waitress... was the one.

757
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:21,330
No.

758
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:22,722
She wasn't.

759
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:24,300
How can you be sure?

760
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:25,731
Well, for starters,

761
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,611
I've known you as a couple
since the beginning of the relationship,

762
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:29,922
which was approximately

763
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,080
three hours ago.

764
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,392
Don't make fun of me.
You're making fun of me.

765
00:37:35,057 --> 00:37:36,063
Sorry.

766
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:43,663
I guess I didn't know her very well.

767
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:48,002
I marked her arm.

768
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:50,573
You... You what?

769
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:55,092
I... I put a mark on her arm.

770
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:01,280
So I could tell 'em apart.

771
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:02,730
I don't...

772
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:04,622
I know, I know.

773
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:08,742
I can't believe I gave her my bike.

774
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:10,442
Yeah.

775
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:13,970
Why do I feel like crap?

776
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:18,070
You just had a rebound.

777
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:21,843
Had a rebound.

778
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:23,502
Yeah.

779
00:38:24,376 --> 00:38:27,700
Which, don't get me wrong,
can be a really fun distraction.

780
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:30,262
But when it's over,

781
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:33,951
you're left thinking
about the girl you really like.

782
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:36,210
The one that broke your heart.

783
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:42,522
I totally rebounded.

784
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:46,540
Someone else shoots,
and I take the ball and I score.

785
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,412
Well, I guess I didn't really score.

786
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:52,093
And I'm not sure
who is actually shooting, but...

787
00:38:52,618 --> 00:38:53,671
Whatever.

788
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:56,283
Doesn't matter. It's all good.

789
00:38:56,905 --> 00:38:58,722
Or as my ex might say,

790
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,650
"Domo arigato, Mister...

791
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:03,673
"Scott-o."

792
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:35,781
Yes, I just wanted to see, if

793
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:39,392
you would like
to come to Jamaica with me.

794
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:42,673
There's this resort called Sandals.

795
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:47,053
Really?

796
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:49,980
Okay.

797
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:53,550
All right.
I promise you won't be disappointed.

798
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,341
It's all-inclusive.

799
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:03,291
Too soon.

800
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:27,862
Night, Pam.

801
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,942
Night.

802
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:32,273
Oh, you know what?

803
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,413
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

804
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:36,742
I intercepted a transmission earlier,

805
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:39,331
and it seems
that the CIA is gonna need Dwight

806
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:42,040
down at their headquarters
at Langley for training

807
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,603
and an ice cream social
with the other agents.

808
00:40:47,138 --> 00:40:48,851
We should get him a bus ticket.

809
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,761
- To make his trip easier.
- Oh, no, that would be very patriotic.

810
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:55,453
It costs $75.

811
00:40:58,316 --> 00:41:00,623
Well, maybe the CIA
could send a helicopter.

812
00:41:09,257 --> 00:41:10,302
What the...

813
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:15,733
"You have been compromised.

814
00:41:15,817 --> 00:41:17,951
"Abort mission. Destroy phone."

815
00:41:19,158 --> 00:41:20,431
Destroy phone.
