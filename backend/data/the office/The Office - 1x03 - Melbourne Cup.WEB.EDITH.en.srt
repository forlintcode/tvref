1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,480
So you'll have those reports
on your desk by 3 p.m.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,160
They were meant to be on my desk by 9 a.m.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,640
And it still can be...

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,760
9 a.m. Standard Pacific time.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,080
Just get it to me ASAP okay?

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,840
No problem. Alisha. Okay. See you later--

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,160
-I've got one more thing.
-Yeah.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,840
-We both know what day it is today.
-Do we?

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,320
-It's Melbourne Cup day.
-Today?

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
Yeah, you know it is.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,440
Oh, actually yeah I was,
I was forgetting but now I'm...

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,600
It is coming back to me.
Yeah it is today isn't it?

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,520
Well as you know, head office has a strict
policy not to celebrate Melbourne Cup.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,120
Yeah, it's a quite a new policy isn't it?

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,080
It's important policy for obvious reasons.

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,840
That is why we won't be celebrating
Melbourne Cup day.

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,360
-Good, just making it clear.
-Okay. Bye Alisha, see ya later!

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
She knows.

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,040
She has to say that every year.
I have to agree every year.

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,840
You know, we do the corporate dance,
blah, blah, blah.

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,800
And I know we've got targets, but when

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,040
it comes down to it,
it's the "Race that stops the nation"!

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,520
Who is ready?

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,160
-Me.
-He's ready.

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,280
-Anyone else?
-[phone rings]

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,680
I'll get you later.

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,480
[theme music playing]

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,560
[Lloyd] I love Melbourne Cup day.

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,120
I organise a sweep every year.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,440
Obviously gambling is a very serious
and complex issue, but,

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,600
you know, Cup day
is just a fun day for the whole family.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,160
-Hey, can I have King's Landing?
-Oh, that's one of the favourites.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,400
-I know.
-What are you doing?

34
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,880
-It's luck of the draw.
-Bingo. King's landing. How lucky is that?

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,520
How would you feel if I reached in
and grabbed some of your cake?

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,440
Don't touch the cake.
Nobody touch the fucking cake.

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,360
[Deborah] I got put on cake duty.
So I palmed it off to the wife and kids.

38
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,520
And they spent three
hours on it last night.

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
-Greta.
-[Greta] Ah, just a moment.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
Greta, Greta.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,720
Sorry. I'm going to have to call you back.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,440
[Hannah] Oh, you weren't
in the middle of something were you?

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Big day today.
Everybody loves Cup day,

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,440
-Do they?
-Yeah.

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,200
And with Danny coming down actually,
and "F on the F"...

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,720
-"F on the F"?
-...Fashion on the field.

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,040
Quite a big day for me.

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,520
So I want to empower you
with a business opportunity.

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,880
And that opportunity is finishing
the business strategy report.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
-When you say finishing…
-It's a WIP…

51
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,400
An early stage WIP.

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
-And when it due?
-3:00 PM

53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,200
-When was it due?
-Irrelevant.

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,560
But if you achieve this task,

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,120
you will earn an almost full bottle

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,079
of, was it prosecco or champagne?

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,680
No, that's,
that's Australian sparkling wine.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,640
And some brie.

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
[phones ringing]

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,960
[Hannah] Today is very special because my
best mate Danny,

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,280
down from the Brizzy office,

62
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
is coming to celebrate Cup Day.

63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,480
He does it every year.
The office bloody loves him.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,880
Okay, I'm just going to tell you.

65
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,240
Umm, ten years ago, we made the pact
that if we were still single at age 40,

66
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,520
then we'd get married and settle down.

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,960
And he turned 40 two weeks ago, and...

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
I just happened to have two
tickets to a moonlit cruise.

69
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,040
So, yeah, maybe I'll bring
the conversation up tonight.

70
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,760
No, ninety's the best I can do.
We only punt on Melbourne Cup day

71
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,880
Not on the prices…

72
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,160
[muffled shouting] The gates are back
and they’re racing in the Cup!

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,480
-[lift dings]
-[Nick] I could send you those by...

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,480
[excitedly] Legs Akimbo
has the early lead.

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,040
Wonder Boy two lengths back
as they approach the bend.

76
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,480
Oh no.
It's Golden Shower in front. 400 to go.

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,320
But ladies and gentlemen,
here comes Wonder Boy.

78
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,800
[excitedly]
Esky drops back as the pace picks up.

79
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,360
Weirdo Woman drops a shoe
and her race is done.

80
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,320
But who's this? There's 200 to go.

81
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,320
Last stretch. It's Sticky Fingers.

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,320
[Danny] Oh, no!
She's overtaken by Wonder Boy now.

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
[Hannah] But I think Sticky Fingers
is making a late break!

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
No. no, no, Wonder Boy's ahead.

85
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,000
-But it's Sticky Fingers by a nose!
-[both laughing]

86
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,920
-How the fuck are you mate?
-[poshly] Ah, a little parched!

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,160
[Danny] Where's the beats?

88
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,760
-[Hannah] Good question. Actually.
-[Danny] That's bad form on your end.

89
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,560
Hey, can you chuck this crab
in the fridge for me Elizabeth

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,560
when you get a sec?

91
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,800
[Hannah] Ah! So good to see you, mate.

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,280
Here is to F on the F,
best suited and best dressed.

93
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,320
Jeez, I hope we win.

94
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,360
Come on. Never stood a chance, did they?

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,399
What is the prize this year?

96
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh, it's not a big deal.
Just a moonlit cruise.

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,880
-What, on the Harbour?
-Parramatta river.

98
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
-Oh, nice.
-Yeah.

99
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,040
And I've also organised
a special little bottle of something.

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,080
Of course she has.

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,680
What, what, what variety of beverage
are we talking?

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
-A little tequila.
-Senorita, Si, sil vous plaît!

103
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Merci, de nada.

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,480
[intense laughter]

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
-[Danny splutters]
-[Hannah] You right?

106
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,400
[Greta] It's not the worst thing to be
locked away from the chaos of Cup day.

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,320
It's nice to have some separation
from Hannah...

108
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,560
and Danny.

109
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,960
Especially Danny.

110
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,840
-[Hannah] We should take a selfie.

111
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,680
-Yeah, up higher, That's good.
-Okay.

112
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,400
Oh, Lizzie, you're just in the back.
Can you...

113
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,440
Can you just duck down?

114
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,080
I'm at my workstation. Working.

115
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,520
Yep. Can you work and duck down?

116
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,320
[mumbles]
Okay.

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,640
Yeah, we're still getting
the top of your helmet.

-Come on.
-Yep.

119

-Just married.
-Huh?

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,000
What? No. I'm kidding.

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080

[Hannah] Stay still...

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,760
Or any other day
that she begins drinking at 9 a.m.

125

-Yeah, absolutely. We'll get--

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
[Greta] What?
Not loving the entertainment?

136
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
It's like footy teams gone maggot
and wrote a rom com.

What we talking? 20 on the nose?

143

for the quinella and an extra 20.

We feeling confident are we?

145

Yeah, I'm gonna take a safe punt
and go toilet cubicle.

a couple of emails and I'll be done.

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,920
-You wanna just hang in with me?
-No, Lizzie's desk is free.

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
[Hannah] Oh, yeah. Didn't even see it.

169
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,480
-That's sweet? Thank you.
-Yeah.

170
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,840
Yeah.

171
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,120
-Hello.
-How's work going?

172
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
[laughs]

173
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,360
Oh, I can't get anything done
with you around.

174
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,560
That's the plan.

175
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
All right,
can I get off this phone call now?

176
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,080
-But we can stay on the line.
-I gotta get this bloody work done.

177
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,240
-All right, you go, you go.
-Love you, love you.

178
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,120
-See you soon.
-Yeah.

179
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,440
Love you. Yeah.

180
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,760
[Lizzie] Umm… What are you doing?

181
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,880
Huh?

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,680
-Oh, working,
-Yes, at my workstation.

183
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,760
-Yeah. I got the boss's permish.

184
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
What?

185
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,840
Yeah. Go and take it up with her.

186
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,120
[Danny] Your mouse sensitivity
is way too sensitive too, by the way.

187
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,640
You won't be having my keyboard
or my screen,

188
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,240
so good luck
doing any high definition work.

189
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,200
Okay.

190
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,880
You need to chill out.
I'll be like, ten minutes Lizzie.

191
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,160
-That's ten minutes too long.
-Jesus.

192
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,360
[Lloyd] Danny.

193
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,960
-Great to see a man at reception hey.
-What?

194
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,520
Shattering the glass ceiling.
Hey, do you want in on the sweeps?

195
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,880
-Ah, yes, I do actually.
-Pick a horse, any horse.

196
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,720
Oh, give us Tutankhamun mate.

197
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,120
Oh, yeah. Good choice. Yeah.

198
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,560
Late money. You could pick that.

199
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,320
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

200
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,480
-Would you drink it with me, though?
-Yes. Yeah, of course I will.

201
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,480
You mean we'd sit
and drink the beer together?

202
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,440
Yes, mate.
Here. Grab it. Get it for me.

203
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,200
[Lizzie] I know when I'm not being
appreciated.

204
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,840
So I have decided to apply my
skill set elsewhere for the day.

205
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
[Lizzie coughs]

206
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,960
-Lizzie?
-Is, umm, is this normal?

207
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,640
Your men over there
slacking off on the job?

208
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,280
-Oh, they're just having a break.
-How long have they been on break?

209
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,360
I don't know.

210
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,920
Well, as productivity manager,

211
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,320
I'm more than happy to step in
and say something, if that's--

212
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,080
Oh, yeah, we're all good.

213
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,280
Here if you need me.

214
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,000
[Danny] You haven't eaten anything.
You've just been smashing booze.

215
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,240
-[Hannah in a posh accent] …bit of crab!
-_[Danny Ready?

216
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,960
-Here you go, oh.
-[both chuckle]

217
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,320
Do you think tonight's the night?

218
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,080
-I don't want to think about it.
-He's into her right?

219
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,960
…two seconds, alright, come here then!
[Hannah squeals with delight]

220
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
Come on.

221
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
-Noogie, noogie, noogie, noogie!
-No, no! Get off, get off!

222
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,840
If you want to hook up with someone,
I don't think you put them in a headlock.

223
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
[Hannah] Hang on.

224
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,520
The quicker I finish this,
then we can play limbo.

225
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,320
No, no, no, keep the shoes on.

226
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,720
-Keep it on, keep it on, keep it on.
-Come on Hannah!

227
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,080
-[Nick shouts] Hannah!
-Oh, just...why would you do that?

228
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,360
-It was nearly 20 bucks richer.
-[Nick] Sorry, different Hannah.

229
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,040
-Here if you need.

230
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
[commentator] We're up to race four at
Flemington,

231
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,080
as we settle in to the biggest day
in the Australian racing calendar.

232
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,480
-Seven minutes thirty.
-Sorry?

233
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,600
That's how long this little coffee break
has been going on for.

234
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,600
-It's morning tea.
-Yeah, well, it's after midday, mate.

235
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,480
So nice try, pal. Not on my watch.

236
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Everything all right?

237
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,640
Well, I think it's time for these boys
to break up the Tea Party, don't you?

238
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,720
-Come on, everyone back to work.
-Lizzie, mate.

239
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,960
Yeah?

240
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
Not your job to tell my staff what to do.

241
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,800
Look, Stevie. I get it.
You want to be a good cop.

242
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
But if you want this place
to run efficient--

243
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,600
If you want this place to run efficiently,
you're going to need a bad cop.

244
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,080
And that is a role
that I'm more than happy to play.

245
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,720
Don't you worry.

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,280
-[phones ring]
-Tina.

247
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,280
-Holy hell.
-Uh oh, look out!

248
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,160
Hottest bird in the office.
[laughs loudly]

249
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,040
-[Danny] Lloyd gets it.
-[Lloyd laughs] Yeah.

250
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,880
[Deborah] Talented niece
you've got there, Tina.

251
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
Isn't she just?

252
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,200
-What's this do?
-Push the button and find out.

253
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
-[Danny] Holy shit.
-[Sebastian] That's awesome!

254
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
You know what? I got a feeling

255
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,360
it's going to be me and you on that
little moonlight cruise tonight, m'lady.

256
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,720
-[Sebastian] Wow.
-[Danny] Look out!

257
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,200
[Danny] She's winning.
[Lloyd] Yeah!

258
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,200
[Danny] Now that's a fascinator!

259
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,960
[Tina]
…and thanks so much for your business.

260
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,360
Have a great week.

261
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,960
Okay. Bye.

262
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,040
[singing] Tina. Cha, cha, cha.
Tina. cha, cha, cha.

263
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,920
Tina, can we just have
a quick online sales meeting?

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,400
-Yeah, sure.
-Look, number one, amazing hat.

265
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,320
-Thanks.
-Love it. Incredible.

266
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,160
Number two, this is so hard for me to say,

267
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,440
but I don't think you can wear it
on fashions in the field.

268
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,360
Okay? Why?

269
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
Well, because you didn't come
to work wearing it.

270
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,760
It's like a technical disqualification.
Like, absolutely heartbroken for you.

271
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,160
But yeah, it sucks, but them's the rules.

272
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,800
Who complained?

273
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,880
-It was anonymous.
-Was it anonymously Tina?

274
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,160
Point is, there's no established rules
for fashion on the field.

275
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,960
We can't just disqualify Tina
because she's got an amazing hat.

276
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,520
It's an okay hat at best.

277
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,720
At worst, it's a toy bird from a $2 shop
stapled to a headband.

278
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,960
[Danny] Three, two, one. Lift off!

279
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,840
[Hannah laughs loudly]
[Danny shouts gleefully]

280
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,240
God, he's a crack up isn't he?

281
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,480
[slurs] Oh! Isn't he just the best?

282
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,600
Hey, maybe you should stop drinking.

283
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
-I'm not drinking.
-I just saw you take a drink.

284
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,920
Oh my God.

285
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,840
-The state of Hannah's paperwork.

286
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,160
[voice] Yoo hoo.

287
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,680
Oh, is that a floating tequila bottle?
I wonder what comes next.

288
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,200
-Me!
-[both] Ah.

289
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,920
-Hi. Oh, my feet are killing me.
-Do you want a seat?

290
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,160
Yeah, I will.

291
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,080
[drunkenly] I just wanted to ask
a little bit of advice here.

292
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,400
Let me put this down.

293
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,360
Umm, obviously Danny and I
are really into each other.

294
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,640
-[Nick] Yeah.
-Okay. Massive.

295
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,520
So I was just wondering, like, do you
think I should try to make a move now,

296
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,960
or, like, pash him later in the toilets?

297
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,200
Oh, options, erm...

298
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,160
Hey, maybe, maybe you should take
some time, sober up a bit,

299
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,040
have a little think before doing anything.

300
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,400
-Yeah, I like that.

301
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,320
Ah… cake!

302
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,080
Oh yum! Yeah. Thank you Deb.

303
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,480
[pallet truck whirs]

304
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,520
Whoa! Lizzie, what are you doing?

305
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Listen, Jimmy

306
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,120
-It's Johnny
-Whatever.

307
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,640
Look, you may think you have what it takes
to help Stevie run this joint,

308
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,960
but from what I have witnessed,
you are a joke.

309
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,920
All right.

310
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,320
Consider yourself warned.

311
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,280
-Changes afoot.
-Whose foot?

312
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Mine.

313
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,240
Oi, Stevie...

314
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,120
[Lloyd] Okay, ladies and germs,
it's time for fashions on the field.

315
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,280
-[staff whoop]
-[Lloyd] Yeah!

316
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,920
Now, just a heads up.

317
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,920
Our contestants will be competing for two
awards, best suited and best dressed.

318
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,120
And both will be receiving tickets
to the Parramatta River cruise.

319
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,760
Oh! Late entry.
Welcome back Hannah.

320
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,360
Very good.

321
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,040
-You're blind.
-You're blind.

322
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,800
[Lloyd] So, by way of applause,
let's find our winners.

323
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,440
First up, Deborah!

324
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,800
[Staff cheer]
[light applause]

325
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,960
[Lloyd] Very nice.
Very nice. Next up is Danny.

326
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
[Hannah cheers loudly]

327
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,200
-It's embarrassing. It's embarrassing.
[Hannah] Take it off!

328
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,960
[Hannah] Take it off!

329
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,400
-[more applause]
-[Lloyd] Yes!

330
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,920
[Danny] Just havin' a laugh, couldn't give
a shit!

331
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,000
I would.

332

[Lloyd] Ah, who's next?

333
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,720
[Hannah] Martin.

334
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,520
Martin, do you want to have a go?
Come on. You've got a nice suit on.

335
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,240
-Take it off.
-[Martin] No, thanks.

336
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,400
[All] Take it off. Take it off.
-No, no, Lloyd...

337
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,280
-[Danny] Get your old boy out!
-Take it off.

338
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,720
-[Danny] Get it out!
-No!

340
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,400
[Lloyd] Okay. Next up, it's Tina.

341

-Yay Tina!

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,440
That is bloody good!

345
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,880
A hat that moves.

346
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
And then. Hannah.

347
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,400
[polite applause]

348
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
[drunkenly] Sorry not, not Tina.

349
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,440
I haven't got a dead bird on my head.

350
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,360
Sorry, I didn't kill anything.

351
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,160
Just the vibe! [chuckles]

352
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,400
[Lloyd] Okay, well...

353
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,800
so I think we know who our winners are,

354
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,360

gorgeous Parramatta river!

359

-Another one under the belt.

[indistinct chatter]

361
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Hey, where should we go
for that drink tonight?

362
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,880
Yep. Lizzie, I reckon it's time
you headed back upstairs.

363
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,520
Why did someone ask me
to come back with something?

364
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,480
-Yep.
-Yeah?

365
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Yep. They did, they did.

366
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,120
It's all gone to hell up there
without you, mate.

367
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,480
All the same,
I've got a job to complete down here

368
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,320
so they can just sit in chaos and wait.

369
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,160
Yes, except you don't have a job
to complete down here,

370
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,040
so step away from the forklift.

371
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,080
-Let it go.
-Fine

-[forklift starts up]
-[Jonny] Hey wait!

373
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,000
[Lizzie] Oh, boy. Excuse me.

374
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,960
-Coming through.
-[Stevie] Lizzie, what are you doing?

375
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,440
-[Lizzie] I know what I'm doing!
-[Stevie] Jesus, Lizzie!

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
-[forklift engine roars]
-Stay back. Are you all right?

377
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,000
-[Stevie] Get out of the forklift!
-[Lizzie] Get out the way!

378
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,760
-[Jonny] Chill out, chill out, chill out.
-[Stevie] Lizzie stop!

379
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,520
Stop! Keys, now!

380
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,240
What is wrong with you mate?

381
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,600
[Lizzie] Your accelerator pedal is way too
sensitive by the way!

382
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,520
[Stevie] Jesus Christ!

383
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,000
[Danny] Oh mate, I'm nervous.

384
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,920
[radio] What an absolute honour
and privilege it is to say…

385
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
-[Hannah] I'm nervous.
-[Deb] Fucks sake!

386
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,960
[radio] …is race number seven.
The Melbourne Cup.

387
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,200
[Hannah] So I bought Tina's
river cruise ticket

388
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,360
so we could still go together tonight.

389
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,640
Oh, Hey. You can have mine.

390
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,840
Yeah. I don't need it anymore.

391
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,640
I got, I got a dinner date on tonight.
You can have that.

392
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,120
[disappointedly] Oh.

393
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,320
Okay. Oh. Who, who with?

394
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,720
Oh, just this this
this chick I met online.

395
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
She's super cool. Early days.

396
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,360
I mean, we're not getting married
or anything.

397
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,520
-No.
-But if we do. Best man?

398
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
-Yeah.
-[Danny laughs]

399
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,160
Ha. Wow. What, um...

400
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,080
She Sydney based?

401
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,480
-Yeah.
-What's her name?

402
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,600
-Maryanne.
-The full name?

[TV] …A cracking day.
The race is over for another year...

417
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,240
Did I miss it? Oh no, who won?

418
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,840
[Sebastian] At least the horse died
doing something it loved.

419
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,680
That's true. It's still a bit sad, though.

420
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,240
[TV] A sad end for Tutankhamen.

421

But let's not let it take away
from Hello Kitty.

-A great win…
-Wait a minute. Did they say Hello Kitty?

That's my horse. I've never won anything.

Oh my God. Have I won all of that money?

Oh. Oh, that's so sad, though, isn't it?

426

-Oh, bye Danny.

-I'll take you to the loo.
-Yeah.

442
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,320
Can you just hold my hair back.
I just washed it.

443
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,680
Yeah, of course I can.

448
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,840
