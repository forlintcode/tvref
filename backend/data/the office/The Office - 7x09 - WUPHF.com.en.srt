00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,688
- My gym allows it.

180
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:21,288
I wish they didn't,
but it's policy.

181
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:23,568
So I respect it,
and I just--

182
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:26,328
keep a low--you know,
I look away.

183
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:28,408
Think about your commission cap

184
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:33,528
as a naked old man
in a gym locker room.

185
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:34,728
- Excuse me, everyone.

186
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,048
Sex!

187
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:38,208
Now that I have
your attention...

188
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,728
- you don't have our attention.

189
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:40,728
- Money!

190
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:42,208
- I'm listening.

191
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,328
- You had me at "sex."

192
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:44,328
- Pervert.

193
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:45,328
- You have all of our attention

194
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:46,608
just by screaming anything.

195
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:47,728
- That's good to know.

196
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,328
[screams]

197
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:50,328
- What do you want
to say, Michael?

198
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:52,728
- Wuphf!

199
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:53,968
All right,
I've warmed them up for you.

200
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:55,048
You have the floor, Ryan.

201
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,848
- How's everybody doing?
- Whoo!

202
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:59,288
- Good!

203
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,368
Now, a lot of you have already
staked out

204
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:02,088
your corner of the wuphf empire.

205
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:06,488
Raise your hand
if I'm describing you.

206
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:07,768
Great.

207
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,208
- Yes, I have a dream.

208
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,968
And It's not some m.L.K. Dream
for equality.

209
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:17,488
I want to own
a decommissioned lighthouse.

210
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,528
And I want to live
at the top.

211
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:22,208
And nobody knows I live there.

212
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,488
And there's a button
that I can press,

213
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:29,728
and it'll launch that lighthouse
into space.

214
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:30,888
- For my current Investors,

215
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:32,328
things are going great.

216
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,408
- We already have a buyer.

217
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:34,408
- Really? Who?

218
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:35,808
- Washington university.

219
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:37,688
I don't even want
to think about selling

220
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:38,728
until our numbers
get into the billions.

221
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,328
- At least.

222
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:43,328
- So I've decided to open up
a second round of investment

223
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:45,488
to friends and family.

224
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,928
- Oh, god. Hold on to
your wallets, ladies.

225
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:48,928
- Did you ever think of wuphf

226
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:51,208
as an EMERGENCY notification
system,

227
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,208
like, for college campuses
with shooters or gas leaks?

228
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,168
- No, no--Oscar, it's not--

229
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:56,448
it's not a digital rape whistle.

230
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:58,168
Wuphf is about fun.
- That's right.

231
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:00,168
- Fun, communication,
connection.

232
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:01,968
- What's your money situation?

233
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,088
- Well, it's tight,
as with any start-up.

234
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:06,208
- Sure, how long can you sustain
this without a cash infusion?

235
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,728
- We have nine solid days.

236
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,648
I love these questions.
Keep 'em coming.

237
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:11,608
- I'm sorry,
nine days until what?

238
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:12,968
- Bankruptcy?

239
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,688
- Wait, Ryan, so this could be
over by the weekend?

240
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,688
- How long do you think
a week is?

241
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,448
- No, not this weekend;
next weekend.

242
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:22,288
We were gonna go
on the investors ski trip.

243
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,894
I bought poles.

244
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,470
- Well, since I have
no incentive to sell,

245
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,750
I've cleaned my car,
organized my desk,

246
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,110
and taken a multivitamin.

247
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,750
So...

248
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,710
what now?

249
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,150
Pam.

250
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,550
[sighs]

251
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,390
Okay, now I've tried everything.

252
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,590
- Did you prank Dwight?

253
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,630
- No.
- Well, you like that.

254
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,910
- Yeah, it's not as fun
if I'm not blowing off work.

255
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,710
- I love you,
but I'm kinda busy,

256
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:58,590
so I need you to figure this one
out on your own.

257
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,910
- [blows raspberry]

258
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,310
- [chuckling]

259
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,590
- Oscar said Wuphf only has

260
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,950
enough money for nine days.

261
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,910
- Check this out.

262
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,630
- All that color.
- Look at that.

263
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,990
Triple your investment
by January.

264
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,390
- Anyone can just throw numbers
up on a chart.

265
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,710
What are you doing
to make it happen?

266
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,550
- Well, earlier today,
I was emailing

267
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,790
someone by the name of
John legend.

268
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,750
- There you go.
- You have his email?

269
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,270
- A lot of these guys
are just Mac.Com,

270
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,910
@ their website whatever.

271
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,950
We get that guy wuphfing,

272
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,950
it's all over.

273
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,710
- I want my money back.

274
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,110
- Do not talk like that,
Stanley.

275
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,310
- Ryan, just tell us your plan.

276
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,750
- Okay, all right.

277
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,950
I know what you wanna see.

278
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,990
I'll be right back.

279
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,110
[smacking door]

280
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,670
Hey, kids, was that fun?

281
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,670
- [all] Yeah!

282
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,670
- All right.

283
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,750
- I wanna go on it again.

284
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,270
- Oh, I bet you do.

285
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,270
You know what?

286
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,390
When I was a little kid,

287
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,710
they couldn't get me
off the hayride.

288
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,150
But it's gonna cost you
three more bucks.

289
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,430
Wow!
This brings back memories.

290
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,630
[inhales deeply]

291
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,030
Hay stacking, hay throwing...

292
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,270
and at the end of it all,

293
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,750
one lucky boy would be crowned
hay king.

294
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,910
I always wanted
to be hay king.

295
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:18,550
The world shines on Mose.

296
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,590
- Where have you been?
I've been waiting.

297
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,190
- Uh, can we move this
to the end of the day?

298
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,310
- No, I--I think you should
make time for it.

299
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,670
- I found the needle
in the haystack!

300
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,630
- Hey, congratulations.
Do you know what your prize is?

301
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,950
- I don't know.

302
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,590
- Nothing. Life lesson?
Some tasks are not worth doing.

303
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,750
- Dwight?

304
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,270
- Wuphf T-shirts.

305
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,710
Who wants one?

306
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,030
Just imagine that you're
at spring break daytona beach.

307
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,030
- Here we go.
- Okay?

308
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,550
Everyone's like, "hey dude,

309
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,990
what's up with all the hotties
in the wuphf shirts?"

310
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,710
Or, Uh, "hey, what's up
with that helicopter?"

311
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,510
"It's ry from wuphf!"

312
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,590
- "It's Ryan the wuphf guy!"
- "Yo, ry from wuphf!"

313
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,230
- "He's up there."
- "What's he dropping?"

314
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,150
"Wow, what's falling on
us, man?"

315
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,590
Wuphf condoms!

316
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,390
50,000 condoms
out of the sky.

317
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,710
- Look at that!
He threw 'em on the ground!

318
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,390
- Look, this is
a marketing campaign.

319
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,430
You got nine days.

320
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,470
Let's say you do get the money.

321
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,590
What are you going
to do with it?

322
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,710
- The first lesson of silicon
valley, actually,

323
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,750
is that you only think
about the user, the experience.

324
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,270
You actually don't think
about the money.

325
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,270
Ever.

326
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,590
- That sounds weird.

327
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,590
- No, it's not weird, Andy,
and you know what else?

328
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,870
We have an offer
from Washington university.

329
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,670
So monetize that.

330
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,710
- Are you guys meeting
about wuphf?

331
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,870
You know that that
was my idea, right?

332
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,990
- [gasps]

333
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,990
- I said to Ryan,
"I try to call you,

334
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,310
"and you don't have your phone.

335
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,990
"I try to I.M. You,
and you're not online.

336
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,750
"I wish there was a way that I
could do everything all at once,

337
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,950
"and I could just be like this
little dog going,

338
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,390
'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'"

339
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,550
- baby, baby, baby--
- I think I'm gonna stay here.

340
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,630
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I do, I do.

341
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,150
This isn't right.

342
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,470
- I help you with your things,
and you help me with my things.

343
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,670
- But I--it's not right.

344
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,670
- [whIspering] I got this,
it's okay,

345
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,150
don't worry about this.

346
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,750
- Is it any particular branch
of Washington university?

347
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,950
- The Washington university
Public health fund.

348
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,270
- W.U.P.H.F.

349
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,510
- Oh, god.

350
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,870
- They only want it
for the initials.

351
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,670
- The domain name.
Yeah, they do.

352
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,630
- I move we sell.

353
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,470
- What?
- Yeah, sell.

354
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,630
- Sell.
- Get us out of this.

355
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,230
- Have some faith in this idea.

356
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,110
- If everybody wants to sell,
we sell, right?

357
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,270
- I won't sell.

358
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,390
And you know what?

359
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,710
Ryan and I have
the majority of shares.

360
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,870
Isn't that right?
- Yes.

361
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,870
You alone do, actually.

362
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,870
- I--yes.

363
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,270
We're not selling.

364
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,230
I will not sell.

365
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,150
[children laughing]

366
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,750
- Awesome.

367
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,150
- Do you mind if we
share this bale?

368
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,790
- Sure.

369
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,070
- There's no charge
to sit on the hay, is there?

370
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,670
- Probably.

371
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,510
- I mean, wouldn't you think

372
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,310
the Ten dollars
to build your own Broom

373
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,830
would include the hay
and not just the instructions?

374
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,230
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, I'm starting to think

375
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,550
this guy is just trying to make
money off the holiday.

376
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,870
- Yeah, instead of hay place
it should be pay place.

377
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,870
- [laughs]

378
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,910
- Don't laugh at me.

379
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,950
- No, no, no, I wasn't--

380
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,830
I was just laughing
at your joke.

381
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,430
- Oh.

382
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,950
- Pay place.
- Mm.

383
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,710
Yeah, so we can celebrate
Thanksgiving-me-your-money day.

384
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,790
- [laughs]

385
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,950
That's humorous.

386
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,990
- Thank you.

387
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,550
- You guys know how to get out?

388
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,390
[kids shouting]

389
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,750
- Hi, Michael.

390
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,630
- Can't talk, saving the planet.

391
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,150
- Oh, we don't recycle.

392
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,590
- We don't?

393
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,830
Well, why have I been
separating the trash

394
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,070
into Whites and colors?

395
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,550
- I'm sure no one
asked you to do that.

396
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,750
- Eight years.

397
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,310
- Listen, I know
you really like Ryan--

398
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,030
- no, I won't even consider it.

399
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,710
- Michael, I...

400
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,750
I hate to say this, but...

401
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,630
You know this special bond

402
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,510
that you've always felt
with Ryan,

403
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,310
where, like, you're best friends

404
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,790
or you're his mentor
or something?

405
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,910
- Right, Yes, yeah.
Best friend/mentor.

406
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,150
- Michael, I think that
that feeling only goes one way.

407
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,150
And I think
that Ryan knows that,

408
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,590
and he's taking advantage
of you.

409
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,350
- I think you are wrong.

410
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,990
- And there are a lot
of other people in This office

411
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,430
who have money at stake.

412
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,630
Other people you care about.

413
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,630
- You may be right.

414
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,630
I may be crazy.

415
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,990
- Don't.

416
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,630
- I'm just saying that I think
I agree with your point.

417
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,510
- Yeah, but in a jokey way where
you're gonna start singing.

418
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,350
- I thought it might make me
feel better.

419
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,270
- Okay.

420
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,150
Go ahead.

421
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,350
- ♪ But it just may be
a lunatic... ♪

422
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,395
no.

423
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,855
- Ooh, nice, wasting time,
here we go.

424
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:40,015
- Hey, back off.
It's solitaire.

425
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:41,895
- Hey, kid--

426
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:42,895
hear you're looking for work.

427
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:43,895
- Talk to me.

428
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:44,895
- How far can you reach

429
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:47,775
those Lovely long arms of yours?

430
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:48,855
Eh, put 'em down.

431
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,175
How long

432
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:52,335
can you hold that pretty little
breath of yours?

433
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:53,535
- [inhales]

434
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:55,855
- Good.

435
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,375
- Hey, Jim?

436
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,975
Are you distracting
these people?

437
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:01,935
- We're working.

438
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,695
- Can you at least
<i>try</i> to look busy?

439
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,455
- [exhales]

440
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:07,575
- The moment Darla put
the cupcake in her mouth,

441
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,015
her daddy pulled her aside
and said,

442
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,335
"you're too fat.

443
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,335
No one's gonna like you
if you're too fat."

444
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:18,415
The next time I saw David Geffen
was at the buffalo club.

445
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:21,495
"I love you, you gay bastard,"
I said.

446
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:23,815
"You gay bastard," I s--

447
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:25,375
"gay ba--"

448
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:31,455
"gay B--"

449
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:33,095
- Michael, how's it going, bro?

450
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:34,495
- Good, good, bro.

451
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,015
- Hey, thanks so much for having
my back out there.

452
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:37,535
- Always have your back.

453
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:40,615
So any ideas on how we can get
over this nine-day hump here?

454
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:42,855
- I have nothing but ideas.

455
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,455
The thing is,
they all require money.

456
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:47,015
- Nine days, though.
That's, like...

457
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,615
- look, I know I've tapped you
so hard.

458
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,615
- Yes, you have tapped this.
Hard.

459
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,055
- [laughs]

460
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:53,575
Oh, you are funny, Michael.

461
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:55,615
You--people--people don't give
you enough credit.

462
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:58,375
- Maybe I could take a second
mortgage on my condo.

463
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,735
- Well, a lot of people
are doing that.

464
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,375
And there don't seem to be
any consequences.

465
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,535
And they say the rates
have never been lower.

466
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:06,815
- So you would think
that's a good idea for me to do?

467
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,295
- Think about this:

468
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:10,815
You and me on a private plane

469
00:16:10,815 --> 00:16:13,375
flown by our private pilot--
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,055
- Eating our private meal cooked
by our private chef.

471
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,375
- Yeah, well, we never even have
dinner now, so...

472
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,375
- we totally should.

473
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,375
- Tonight?

474
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,935
- I gotta work on this.

475
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,575
- Oh, right.
What am I saying?

476
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:24,575
Rain check.

477
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,055
- Yeah.

478
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,455
- And now, by show of applause,

479
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:33,615
we will crown this year's
hay king.

480
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,935
All in favor of purebred.

481
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:36,935
[applause]

482
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,815
Put your hands together
for...

483
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:39,815
mixed bread.

484
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,375
[applause]

485
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,895
And Let's hear it for...

486
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:43,895
purebred.

487
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:44,935
[applause]

488
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,495
Mm.

489
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:48,415
It would appear we have
a three-way tie.

490
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,535
I have no choice but to pick
the hay king myself.

491
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:55,335
I pick...

492
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:56,695
me!

493
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:58,495
I am your hay king!

494
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:04,215
All Hail your hay king!

495
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:06,655
Did I truck 300 Bales of hay

496
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:11,615
to a parking lot to rectify
some childhood disappointment?

497
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,135
Yes.

498
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,615
- So if I were
to call dunder Mifflin

499
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:16,735
and ask for miss Angela Martin,

500
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,415
would I get through to you?

501
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:22,295
- You would.

502
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,735
And if I were to call your House
and ask for your wife,

503
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,815
would I get through to you?

504
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:29,015
- My wife passed away
a few years ago.

505
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,935
- How tragic.

506
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:32,375
Very sorry to hear that.

507
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,815
- Thank you.

508
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:37,175
- Help!

509
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:39,815
Hello?

510
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:46,375
Oh!
Help!

511
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,775
- Consider it a wuphf
in person.

512
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,255
- You're doing the wrong thing.

513
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:51,375
You're gonna lose
Michael's investment,

514
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,735
you're gonna lose ours.

515
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:55,375
- You got this crazy opportunity
to get our money back.

516
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,815
Tell Mike to sell.

517
00:17:56,815 --> 00:17:58,775
- If you tell Michael to sell,
he'll sell.

518
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:01,095
- I'm betting on myself.

519
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,615
- It's a bad bet.

520
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,615
- Hello.

521
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,815
- Hey.
It's an ambush here.

522
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:07,215
Nobody here believes
in this company.

523
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:08,415
Will you tell them
they're wrong?

524
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:10,055
- It's not that we don't believe
in the company.

525
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,135
We don't believe in you.

526
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:12,895
- All those in favor of selling,
say aye.

527
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:13,895
- Aye.
- Aye.

528
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:16,175
- Aye.
- Aye.

529
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:19,535
- Aye.

530
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:22,895
Do not agree to sell,
which is to say nay.

531
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,495
- What is wrong with you?

532
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:26,375
What happened to you
in high school?

533
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,695
- Michael, are you that blind?

534
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:28,815
- I'm not blind!

535
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:30,775
I know exactly who he is.

536
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:34,015
He is selfish and lazy
and image-obsessed,

537
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:37,135
and he is a bad friend.

538
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:39,135
And he's also clever.

539
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,535
And he shoots incredibly high.

540
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,455
And he may just make it.

541
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,175
But you know what,
even If he doesn't,

542
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:48,455
I would rather go broke
betting on my people

543
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,495
than get rich all by myself

544
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,535
on some island
like a castaway.

545
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:54,375
And there is no middle ground.

546
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,455
- You're gonna lose
all of our money.

547
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,895
- Only If he fails.

548
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,495
And you know what?

549
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:00,895
Ryan, I believe in you.

550
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:04,855
Just like I believe
in all of you.

551
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,975
You have nine days to save
Everybody's money.

552
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:09,455
- Oh...

553
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:10,695
that's a lot of pressure.

554
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:12,695
I--I'm gonna need
some more time.

555
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:16,535
- You can't have it.

556
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,375
- Okay.

557
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:27,735
I won't let you down.

558
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:30,415
- Angela?

559
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:40,655
Angela!

560
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:44,455
- The world sends people
your way...

561
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:46,535
Ryan came to me
through a temp agency.

562
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:49,735
Andy was transferred here.

563
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,535
No idea where Creed came from.

564
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:53,135
The point is

565
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:56,495
you just have to play with
the cards that you're dealt.

566
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,975
Jim, that guy is an ace.

567
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:00,655
Dwight is my king Up my sleeve.

568
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:02,095
Phyllis is my old maid.

569
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:03,495
Oscar is my queen.

570
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,455
That's easy.

571
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:05,775
Gimme a hard one.

572
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,855
That's what Oscar said.

573
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:10,575
Toby is the instruction card
you throw away.

574
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,375
Pam's a solid seven.

575
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,375
And Yeah, you know what?

576
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,255
Ryan is probably, like, a two.

577
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,335
But sometimes twos
can be wild.

578
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:18,415
So watch out.

579
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:21,295
And I am obviously the joker.

580
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:23,655
So...
[phone rings]

581
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,335
[phone rings]
that's, uh--

582
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,335
[melodic tone]

583
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:28,695
[robotic voice]
- wuphf from Ryan Howard.

584
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,375
Decided to sell company.

585
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,975
Thanks, bro.
Hell of a ride.

586
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:35,208
- Thank god.

587
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,932
[phone rings]

588
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:45,932
- Gabe Lewis.

589
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:49,212
- Now, listen here, gabe,
you're too fat.

590
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:50,972
No one's gonna like you
if you're too fat.

591
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:52,932
I made some changes
to my book.

592
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,652
See if you like them.
- Well, jo--

593
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:57,812
- now, I love reading,
and I hate being interrupted.

594
00:20:57,812 --> 00:21:00,332
Shut up and listen,
you gay bastard.

595
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:01,492
Chapter one.

596
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:05,092
I was born, not into luxury
Nor poverty,

597
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:07,572
but into adversity, and for
that, I thank the lord.

598
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:09,932
My father was a man.
That's all we can know.

599
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:10,892
After I learned to ride a bike,

600
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:12,292
there was no stopping me.

601
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:15,772
I would ride up Magnolia Street
and down azalea Lane.

602
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:16,772
Which would later become my--

603
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:17,812
- All right, good night, gabe.

604
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:19,092
Just wanted to say thanks again,

605
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:22,812
'cause I really think I made
good use of my day, oh!

606
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:24,932
Sorry.

607
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:27,372
- And fate has obliged me
with plenty of battles,

608
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:28,892
the first being a hard--
