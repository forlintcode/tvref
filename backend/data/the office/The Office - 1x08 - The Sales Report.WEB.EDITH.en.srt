1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,840
Good morning, Flinley Craddick.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,520
Yes, yeah. I'll try her line.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,640
One moment.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,640
-[Lizzie knocks]
-Yeah.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,960
Alisha called again.
Should I say that you're not here?

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,240
I told you, I don't want a call
from that woman until 5:00 p.m.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,840
Then I shall tell her to back off.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,200
No, don't tell her to back off.
Just tell her I'm not here.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
[Lizzie] Yeah.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,040
Oh my God. When did the agents get here?

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,680
-[Lizzie] 20 minutes ago.
-Why didn't you wake me up?

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,640
You looked so peaceful.
I wasn't sure if you--

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,040
Lizzie, this building is not for lease.
Not yet, okay?

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,960
So, I want them gone. Is that clear?

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
Yes, Captain.

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,320
Don't… "Captain" is very strange.
Please don't say that.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,120
[Hannah] Today is the day
the final sales report is due.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,480
If we don't hit our financial target,

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,480
the office will close

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,880
and we will be forced to work remotely
from the brutal isolation…

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,560
-[fire alarm rings]
-…of our own home.

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,920
[alarm keeps beeping shrilly]

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,560
[Sebastian] Please, this way, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,720
[automated fire warning]
Emergency. Evacuate now.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,640
[theme music playing]

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,920
Okay, let's talk numbers.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
They're shithouse.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,400
Well, that's not the attitude
I need right now, Deb.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,200
-Just being honest.
-Well, be less honest.

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,920
But also, give it to me straight,

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,280
but in a positive and encouraging way.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,880
Okay.

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,520
You're on the right track.

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,800
Love it.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,720
But you're still 220 grand short.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,800
You're the productivity manager.
What have you got for me?

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,680
Funny you should ask
because I have started

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,840
an Act4Change petition
to keep the office open,

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,800
and it's already got one signature.

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,039
Yeah. It's yours.

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,040
I don't think the lazy activist route
is going to save us, Lizzie.

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,560
It saved Karol Wilcox's dog in 2014
from getting executed for killing a duck.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,800
636,000 signatures.

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,560
[phone ringing]

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,240
Good morning, Flinley Craddick…

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,040
Yeah. Yeah. One moment.

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,480
[whispering] Um, Hannah?
Hannah, it's Alisha.

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,280
Are you here yet, or…?

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
Okay, got it.

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,720
I'm sorry. She sliced her neck open.

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,120
Can I take a message?

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,040
-Hey.
-Hey, Martin.

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,840
Um, have you heard from Nick?

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,000
[Martin] Yeah.

55
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,960
Like… like, heard his actual voice?

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
Yeah, we chatted on the phone.

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,120
And did he sound sick?

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,960
Nah, not really.

59
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,720
Could be a sprained ankle, I guess.

60
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,280
[Martin] He said it was laryngitis.

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
Oh, cool.

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,800
[Greta] No, Nick didn't ask me out.

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
Not like out-out.

64
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,079
No, he just suggested grabbing dinner

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,000
and then Mason called and I had to go.

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
It's no big deal.

67
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,600
He's just been sick

68
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,960
every day

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,320
since then.

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,360
[bell ringing]

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
Okay, people!

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,920
Today is D-day,

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,280
and "D" stands for, "Let's do it!"

74
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,120
And that is why on this day,
I'm putting you all on sales.

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,360
Every one of you.

76
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,880
We've got until 5:00 p.m. to make 220K,
so let's go!

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,520
Whoo!

78
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,560
[Deborah] 220K by 5:00 p.m.?

79
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,280
Is a joke.

80
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,440
[Hannah groans]

81
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,120
We need to mobilise, people.

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
Okay? We gotta hit the phones.

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,079
We gotta share our clients.

84
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,840
We gotta, I don't know, sell your body.

85
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,320
Find a sugar daddy.

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
Where is Nick?

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,720
He's sick.

88
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,760
[Hannah] Today?

89
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,280
Okay, well, let's think global, all right?

90
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Um, ah, what's… what's the time?

91
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,720
-What countries are still trading?
-It's 10:32.

92
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,440
It's 10:32. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is.

93
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,080
So, America is closed. London is closed.

94
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,440
Japan's open. The Solomon Islands.

95
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
-[Hannah] Yes! Yes!
-South Korea.

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
-North Korea. Russia.
-North Korea's probably out.

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,760
-But Russia! Holy moly.
-[Lizzie] They're open.

98
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,079
-[Lizzie] Yeah.
-Whatever it takes, let's get a-sellin'!

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
[jingles bell loudly]

100
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,320
[Hannah] Whoo!

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
[Lizzie] Do I want to go remote?
Not relevant.

102
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,440
Do I want to support the vision
of my branch manager?

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,000
At all costs.

104
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,640
[Greta] What are you doing?

105
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,920
I am in sales now,

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
and seeing as a certain sales rep
didn't show up,

107
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,960
I shall be taking his spot.

108
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,200
If I had to finish my work placement
from home, I think I'd be okay.

109
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,960
Lizzie, pull up Nick's client list.

110
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,720
With pleasure.

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,080
-Okay.
-[computer beeps]

112
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,200
Ooh. It's password-protected.

113
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
Uh, try Nickiscool69.

114
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,480
Nickiscool…

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,480
-[PC beeps]
-Nope.

116
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,480
Ooh, how about "Nickisnotcool68"?

117
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
-[PC beeps]
-Greta, what's Nick's password?

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
Can't say.

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,600
Yeah, you know what? You're right.
No one likes a snitch.

120
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,360
Lloyd? What's Nick's password?

121
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,920
Um, "Lizzie is my bestie,"

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
and all the i's are exclamation marks.

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,200
Lizzie is my bestie…

124
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,920
-[PC chimes]
-Oh, right. Print that out for me.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,120
Will do.

126
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,200
-For the record, Nick is not my bestie.
-[phone line rings]

127
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,880
Hi, David, this is Hannah Howard
from Flinley Craddick Packaging.

128
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,200
How are you going?

129
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Nick Fletcher, yes,
but he's away at the moment,

130
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,000
so I just thought
I'd give you a little nudge.

131
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,000
[elevator dings]

132
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,920
[Hannah] Yeah. Okay.

133
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,560
No, that is no worries at all.

134
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,680
Um, you sure I couldn't convince you?

135
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,120
No. All right.

136
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,120
-Well, if you do…
-[door opens]

137
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,720
…change your mind, just give me a call.

138
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,200
But the offer is only available
till 4:59 p.m. today.

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
Okay, bye.

140
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
Yeah.

141
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,560
G'day, Hannah. You right if we borrow
some of your fridge space?

142
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,080
We just have a barbie downstairs
and ours is chockers.

143
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,120
[Hannah] A barbecue?

144
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
It's actually quite a busy day for us.

145
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,400
Oh, no, it's just a warehouse thing.
For Jonny's birthday.

146
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,720
It's just my birthday, so.

147
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,120
Oh, actually…

148
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,960
[mutters indistinctly]

149
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,960
Uh, hey, everyone!

150
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,080
It's Jonny's birthday.

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
Having a barbecue in the warehouse.

152
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,600
So, whoever makes the most sales
gets all you can eat sausages!

153
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,040
-All you can eat?
-[Hannah] Yeah.

154
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,120
So, yeah, chuck 'em in the fridge.
We'll catch you.

155
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,120
[Lloyd] Who uses packaging? Question.

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,040
Uh, I'd like to speak
to your manager, please.

157
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, certainly. It is about a big sale.

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,240
Yeah, yeah. Happy to hold.

159
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,480
[bright on hold music playing]

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,120
Got a big fish on the line.
Just got to reel 'em in.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,360
More of a shark, actually.

162
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,120
What would you say if I told you
that that shark was Tetra Pak?

163
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,640
I'd say Tetra Pak is a packaging company.
Why bother with them?

164
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,960
Well, who does their packaging? Huh?

165
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,800
Mm, okay. Good luck with that.

166
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
[Lizzie] Yeah.

167
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,760
[elevator dings]

168
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,680
That's my desk.

169
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,080
You snooze, you lose.

170
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,280
[Hannah] Yeah, I know that Nick
usually looks after you, but he's sick.

171
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,680
I'll call you back.

172
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,840
Nickelodeon!

173
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,320
Um, ah…

174
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,360
Better late than never.

175
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,200
Um, I had a client call me

176
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,360
saying that you'd been
hassling them on the phone.

177
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,880
Hassling? More like hustling.

178
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,920
Yeah, we're under a lot
of pressure today, so, yeah,

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,200
I've been picking up the slack.

180
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
Right. So you just open up my computer

181
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,000
and just help yourself
to my personal contact list.

182
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,240
Personal and professional.

183
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Now, Sean Atwood at Bigger is Better.
Who is that?

184
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
Yeah. Sean renewed his order last month.

185
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,120
Okay. Nellie at Georgio.
Is that as in Armani?

186
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,360
No, as in my hairdresser.

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,960
-Okay. Is she a client?
-No, as in, my actual hairdresser.

188
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,920
-Can I have my contact list back?
-Gregor Best.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,840
-He's a major player, right?
-Yes.

190
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,720
Yes, and his order's up
for renewal this week.

191
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,400
-Okay, let's give him a call.
-No, don't call him.

192
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,000
He told me he didn't want
to be disturbed today

193
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,400
because he's dealing with
personal matters.

194
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,159
-So, I'll just call him tomorrow.
-Tomorrow's too late.

195
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah? I think he'd appreciate a call
from the top diggity dog.

196
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,320
-No, Hannah, you don't understand.
-Hang on, shh! Voicemail.

197
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Hi, this is Hannah Howard
from Flinley Craddick Packaging.

198
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm the MD here, just calling you
to check up on a little order

199
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,880
that Nick mentioned to me…

200
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,720
Um, if anyone needs me, I'll be in there
writing my resignation letter, so.

201
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,240
[mumbled disbelief]

202
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,160
No one cares, Nick.

203
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,840
[Nick exhales]

204
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,560
[Tina] Is he joking?

205
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,360
[Lloyd] Yeah, it's a box.

206
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,720
It's a good box.

207
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah, a cardboard box.

208
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,520
So, do you want to buy it?

209
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, okay.

210
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,080
Okay. Bye.

211
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,400
[sighs]

212
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,640
Hey, Debs.

213
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
How do you sell boxes?
Is there like a script or something?

214
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,120
Are you serious?

215
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
I just really love sausages.

216
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,960
Favourite sausage?

217
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,840
Pork and fennel.

218
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,200
[sighs]

219
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,240
[Deborah] Yeah,
I'll survive working remotely.

220
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
Actually be quite nice to look up
and not have Lloyd staring at me.

221
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
[keyboard clacking]

222
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,120
[keeps typing]

223
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,440
[stops typing]

224
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
[approaching footsteps]

225
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,440
-[Greta] Hey.
-Oh, hey.

226
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,280
-Tea?
-Oh, yes, please.

227
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,400
Yep.

228
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,720
Um, I messaged you a few times.

229
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,600
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,400
Sorry, I was a bit slack
on the old replies, you know,

231
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,960
just, um, a bit of a fuzzy brain, so.

232
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Laryngitis, right?

233
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,240
[clears throat] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

234
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,200
Just knocked me around
for a couple of days.

235
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,160
Um… how are you? You good?

236
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

237
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,280
Um… are you serious about quitting?

238
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,320
Yeah.

239
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,840
[Greta] Oh, okay.

240
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,720
[stammering]

241
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
Is that because…?

242
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,160
[Lloyd laughs]
Oh, here they are! Dynamic duo.

243
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
Sales sharks.

244
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,560
Hey, I was wondering, could I please
run my sales script past you?

245
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,080
Do you know what?

246
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,560
Greta's more of the shark than I am,

247
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,040
so I'm gonna leave you
in her capable hands.

248
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,320
Or jaw, depending on how… 'Cause…

249
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,360
-[Nick] Depending on…
-[laughs] Jaw.

250
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,920
Okay, so, ah, I've written this poem.

251
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,840
Um…

252
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,960
Oh, do we have like a Boombox
or a UE Boom?

253
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,160
-'Cause I could rap it.
-I think just do it acapella.

254
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
Oh, okay. Um, so…

255
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
"Knock, knock, Knox
What's in the box?"

256
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,920
"A cat called Socks
Also wearing my jocks"

257
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,440
"What a cute kitty"

258
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,920
What do you think?

259
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Yeah, that's really deadly, brother.

260
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,600
Yes!

261
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,120
[clears throat]

262
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
[Hannah] Gregor!

263
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Hannah Howard here. Again. Just…

264
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,080
-[phone ringing]
Oh, not now, Alisha. Come on.

265
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,600
[Alisha] Hello? Hannah?

266
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,920
Um… ah, yeah.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
Just… I didn't say,

268
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,840
but we are going to throw in
some free bubble wrap.

269
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,840
[laughs]

270
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,120
So, yeah, give me a call.

271
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,040
[mutters] Oh, God.

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,640
[sighs softly]

273
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
[Lizzie] Psst!

274
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,160
[softly] I have landed the eagle.

275
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,800
What are you talking about?

276
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,760
I have a very sizeable offer on the table.

277
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,280
-Who's the client?
-Their username is XPRZylon#2833.

278
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,040
And let's just say, Zylon is willing
to go to 150K in Bitcoin

279
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,680
for 500 "bespoke" boxes.

280
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,960
150K?

281
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Yes.

282
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,960
[Lizzie] If someone wants a supply of 500

283
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,800
adult-sized boxes
with built-in ventilation,

284
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
who am I to question it?

285
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,960
Deb, can we put Bitcoin
through the accounts?

286
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,280
No. Flinley Craddick
does not deal in crypto.

287
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
[Hannah] But…

288
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,720
[Hannah] Okay.

289
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,840
-Ask him if he can do Aussie dollars.
-[knock at door]

290
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,960
-Hey, Hannah, just going for a…
-Not now, Martin. We're busy.

291
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,000
[Lizzie] Shut the door.

292
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,760
Come on, Zylon. Come on.

293
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,800
-What are you doing?
-Our job, Martin.

294
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm sorry, is this the dark web?

295
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,280
No, it's not the dark web. Is it, Lizzie?

296
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,640
I can confirm it is the dark web
and… boom!

297
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,400
150K Aussie dollars.

298
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,240
-Oh my God. Close the deal.
-[Lizzie] Yeah.

299
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,040
Do not. No,
we're not gonna close the deal.

300
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,520
Zylon's offering $150,000.

301
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,160
Okay, well, Zylon is possibly a criminal
and probably a human trafficker.

302
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,520
Well, I appreciate your opinion,

303
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,520
but I'm gonna give Zylon
the benefit of the doubt.

304
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,520
-Close the deal.
-Yeah.

305
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,760
Martin!

306
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,800
Okay, Hannah,
I think you just need to calm down.

307
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,800
I think you need to calm down,
that's what I think.

308
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,160
-Okay, well, I'm pretty calm.
-Well, I'm also pretty calm.

309
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,840
-I'm a meditation app.
-[Martin] Okay.

310
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
I'm… I'm wind in a wheat field.

311
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,600
I'm raindrops on a tin roof,
that's what I am.

312
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
-I'm not sure what's going on.
-[phone ringing]

313
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,320
-[Lizzie] It's Gregor Best.
-[Hannah laughs]

314
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,960
Well, well, well.

315
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,720
Looks like someone's luck
is about to turn around.

316
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,840
Hello, Gregor.

317
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,640
[Gregor] I do not appreciate
being harassed

318
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,120
after making it perfectly clear
I'm not available to be contacted today.

319
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
-[line disconnects]
-I'm a big fan of yours too!

320
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,320
[Hannah] You want to make
a big purchase? Great.

321
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,960
-[engaged tone on phone line]
-A business lunch? Yes, please.

322
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
Okay. See you there.

323
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,960
Exciting.

324
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, everyone,
I'm off to land a pretty big deal.

325
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,960
Power lunch. Major player.

326
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Wish me luck. Not that I'll need it.

327
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,920
Power lunch.

328
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,080
-[sighs heavily]
-[Hannah] Major player.

329
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
[Hannah's footsteps receding]

330
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,560
Gotta hand it to Hannah. I mean,
she… she never gives up.

331
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,480
Ever.

332
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,960
Does anyone feel like a game of ping pong?

333
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,440
[crossing beeps]

334
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
[Hannah] Um, yeah.

335
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,880
So, I would like to remortgage
my house today, please.

336
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,160
Okay, let's have a look.

337
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,000
Thank you.

338
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,880
You want a cash lump sum of $220,000.

339
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,600
Mm-hmm! And I'd like that today, please.

340
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,240
I see.

341
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,720
[Lloyd] "Knock, knock, Knox
What's in the box?"

342
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
"A cat wearing socks
Also wearing my jocks…"

343
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,520
Foul. Out.

344
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,280
Hey, Greta? Can I just…?

345
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,480
[indistinct office chatter]

346
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
-[Nick grunts] Hey. Um…
-[Greta] Hey.

347
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,720
I just wanted to address
the elephant in the room.

348
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,960
[Greta laughs]

349
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,000
-Did you find it purely for that joke?
-Yeah. Searched everywhere.

350
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,120
It's amazing what you can find
in the storeroom.

351
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,400
Look, about the other day,
it was never my intention to go anywhere.

352
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,400
Yeah, no, I get it.
I, hey, I'm… I'm sorry.

353
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,960
-I… forget it. I shouldn't have…
-Oh, no!

354
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,840
-You don't have to…
-Yeah, it's cool.

355
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,160
Cool, cool, cool.

356
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,800
Were you planning on avoiding me
for the rest of your life?

357
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,200
That was the plan, yeah, but I failed, so.

358
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,720
-Miserably.
-Mm-hmm.

359
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,360
-Nah.
-Look, let's just go back to, you know…

360
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,080
just being what we've always been.

361
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,360
-What do you mean?
-You know, just friends.

362
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,200
Like, like… But fun friends!

363
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,840
-Butt fun friends?
-But…

364
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,680
-Fun friends only.
-Fun friends.

365
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,200
It'd be my honour to be
your butt fun friend.

366
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
[laughs]

367
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,080
-Okay, I'm gonna leave.
-[Nick] Okay.

368
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,360
-Just make sure you take the elephant.
-Oh, no, please.

369
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,640
You have that, Nick Fletcher.

370
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,200
-Greta King, um…
-It's all yours.

371
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,840
[Nick] Okay.

372
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,640
[moans]

373
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,160
[impassioned cheering and jeering]

374
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,040
[overlapping shouting]

375
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,720
[cheering]

376
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,000
[overlapping shouting]

377
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
[Hannah] What's going on?

378
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,720
[Lizzie] Oh, I mean,

379
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,560
you left and… and chaos ensued,

380
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,360
and I've been trying to shut it down,
but they wouldn't listen to me.

381
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,040
[paper scrunching]

382
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,520
[paper thuds]

383
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,240
All right, I'm going to the barbecue
to eat some meat.

384
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,760
[footsteps leaving]

385
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,520
I hope you're all happy with yourselves.

386
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,440
I, for one, am not.

387
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,839
[Greta] Oh, shit.

388
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
[Deborah] What is it?

389
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,319
Hannah just tried to remortgage her house.

390
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,560
[Lloyd] Well, that is wonderful news.

391
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,920
Have a lovely day.
Great doing business with you.

392
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,000
Guess who just made a sale?

393
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,800
Lloyd did.

394
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
[dead silence]

395
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,960
What did I miss?

396
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,880
Who remortgages their house
just so they can come into work?

397
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,000
I guess Hannah.

398
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
[barbecue sizzles]

399
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,400
-What's up with Hannah?
-Dunno.

400
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Hey, Hannah?
Can I help you with anything?

401
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,480
Can you grab me the barbecue sauce?

402
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,240
Chuck us the barbecue.

403
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Thanks, mate.

404
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,920
Thanks, ma'am.

405
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,440
Good on ya. Yeah.

406
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
[many footsteps approaching]

407
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,760
[Deborah] Emotional eater.

408
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,440
[Lizzie] Let me do the talking, okay?

409
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,280
[Tina] Should we get her a napkin?

410
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,720
15 signatures.

411
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,920
Everybody signed it.

412
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,240
Elizabeth Moyle.

413
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,080
Lloyd Kneath.

414
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,320
Tina Kwong.

415
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,600
And even Nick Fletcher.

416
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,440
Yeah.

417
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,240
Thought I might stick around for a while.

418
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,040
Wow, guys.

419
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,480
Wow.

420
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,800
Thank you very much. It means a lot.

421
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,640
And it proves what I've known all along.

422
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,400
That you love the office
and you want to stay here.

423
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,320
Oh, nah, I think it was more that,
um, we wanted to…

424
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,000
-We felt sorry for you.
-We're still happy to go remote.

425
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,040
But it says "save our office".

426
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,560
It's got all your signatures.
They're all there.

427
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,760
And as your trusted leader, I will not
let these cries fall on deaf ears.

428
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,280
-We will march to the Capitol.
-Whoo! Yes!

429
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
By the Capitol you mean Head Office,

430
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,360
that's in the city
and about a five-hour walk.

431
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,200
Okay, Martin, well,
we'll march to the train station

432
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
and then we'll march to the Capitol.

433
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,640
Sorry, Hannah, I actually made a sale,
so could I get my sausages now?

434
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,640
I… yeah.

435
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,520
Okay, everyone, grab a sausage
and then we'll get going.

436
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,600
Ah, excuse me. Sorry, mate.
Sorry, I'll just take that.

437
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,440
By rights, I should be first.

438
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,880
Um, hi.

439
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,920
-Ah, yep. Everyone, help yourselves.
-[indistinct chatter]

440
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,040
-Hey, happy birthday, mate.
-Yeah, cheers, Lloyd.

441
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,160
Thanks, man.

442
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,760
[Lloyd] Oh, look,
there's lots I'll miss if we go remote.

443
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,000
The chinwags. Communal cheese.

444
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,760
Toaster. Top toaster, four slice.

445
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
We vote no remote.

446
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,120
We vote no remote!

447
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,680
-Everybody now! We vote no remote.
-[Lizzie] Everybody, yeah!

448
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,200
We vote no remote!

449
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,480
-[Hannah] Hey! Oh my God.
-[Lizzie] We vote no remote.

450
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,680
-I mean, obsessed much?
-[Lizzie] Yeah.

451
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,560
[Hannah] Let's see
what she has to say for herself.

452
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,120
Hannah, I've been trying
to reach you all day.

453
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,600
Well, we were just coming to see you.

454
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,600
Well, I'm here now, so can we chat?

455
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Sure.

456
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,280
-I meant in the office.

457
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,000
[Alisha] Hannah,
we had a board meeting yesterday.

458
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,040
Well, that's interesting because that's
what our meetings have become, Alisha.

459
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,560
Bored meetings.

460
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,360
You come in, you tell me
how to do my job, and I'm bored.

461
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,280
We had a board meeting yesterday,

462
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,400
and after reviewing the sales
and productivity of the last quarter,

463
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,640
it's become clear that
since we've gone remote,

464
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,480
there's been considerable downturn.

465
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,960
[laughs]

466
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,240
So, the offices will be reopening

467
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,680
and attendance will be mandatory
four days a week

468
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,520
with flexible start and finish hours.

469
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,320
So, what you're telling me is that

470
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,400
I was right?

471
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,520
Something like that, yes.

472
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,920
[indistinct chatter]

473
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,120
[elevator dings]

474
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,280
[slow clapping continues]

475
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,320
Well, I did it.

476
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,600
I convinced Alisha
to keep the office open.

477
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:37,360
Mandatory attendance four days a week
with flexible start and finish times.

478
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
-Wait, really?
-[Hannah] Yeah.

479
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,120
-So, we get a day at home?
-Yes.

480
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,160
-You convinced Alisha?
-Yeah, I did, Martin.

481
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,840
-Did the petition help?
-Didn't even need it, actually.

482
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,960
So, I shall see you all on the morrow.

483
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,520
Oh, I might work from home tomorrow.

484
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,680
Okay, I shall see the rest of you then.

485
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,080
-I'm gonna take my remote day too.
-Yeah, me too.

486
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,280
Yeah, same.

487
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
I might be sick tomorrow.

488
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,280
Okay, well, the day after. Whatever.

489
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,320
[grunts]

490
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,280
Yay!

491
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,200
-So, are you gonna come in tomorrow?
-Yeah. I think I will. You?

492
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,800
Yeah, I'll think about it.

493
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,680
[Hannah] Am I surprised by
today's victory? Not really.

494
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,280
I set a goal,
and I worked my butt off to achieve it.

495
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,200
Sometimes people ask me,
"Oh, how can I become a great boss?"

496
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,320
How can I do what you do?

497
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,920
And the simple answer is,

498
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,840
you can't.

499
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,480
It's just a quality you're born with.
You either got it or you don't.

500
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,360
We're just a little more charismatic,
a little sharper, and a little bit…

501
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
better.

502
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,920
-Well, Hannah.
-Martin.

503
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,040
It's certainly been
a challenging few weeks, and…

504
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,000
I single-handedly turned it around? Yeah.

505
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
That's why I get paid the big bucks,
I guess.

506
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,200
Yeah.

507
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,040
And I heard all the other branches
are reopening too.

508
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,240
Huh. Really?

509
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,560
I heard it was actually a directive
from Head Office.

510
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,440
Well, don't think we need to get
caught up in the nitty-gritty, Martin.

511
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,440
-Nah.
-Nah.

512
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,160
But that is what happened, so,
you didn't actually save the--

513
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,880
Okay. Thank you, Martin.

514
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,720
-I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
-No one's coming in tomorrow Hannah.

515
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,880
[Hannah] We'll see.

516
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,160
[elevator dings]

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,720
