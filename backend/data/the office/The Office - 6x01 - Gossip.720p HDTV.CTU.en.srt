{\pos(192,240)}And it was in one of the Bond films.
It's pretty impressive.

8
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:24,687
{\pos(192,240)}The goal is to get from point A
to point B as creatively as possible.

9
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:28,318
{\pos(192,240)}So technically they are doing parkour
as long as point A is delusion

10
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,320
and point B is the hospital.

11
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:42,306

Jump over it.
Jump over the camera.

Jump over the camera.

64
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:16,150
{\pos(192,220)}Jim's being marched down the aisle
by my dad with a shotgun.

65
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:19,419
Wait,
there's not gonna be a shotgun?

66
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:20,594
No shotgun?

67
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:24,390
- 'Cause that changes everything.
- Can't back out now, Halpert.

68
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:27,915
What are you gonna do about it?
There's no shotgun, so...

69
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:30,903
Free at last. Free at last.

70
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,659
No, keep it up.

71
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:36,836
You'll never guess what I know.

72
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:38,383
Let me finish this thought.

73
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,009
Eric likes Megan.

74
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,637
He most definitely does.

75
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,974
He's been asking her out{\ repeatedly} for weeks.
She finally said yes.

76
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,477
They went out {\on a quick date }the other night.
Apparently it went very well.

77
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:52,184
- How do you know this?
- People tell me things.

78
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,244
I guess I have a face you can trust.

79
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:57,048
I think
it's because of my low cheekbones.

80
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:58,342
And...

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,989
Okay, what is it?
What can't I guess?

82
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:04,282
I hate, hate, hate being left out.

83
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:07,595
Whether
it's not being picked for a team

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,253
or being picked for a team
and then showing up

85
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:12,978
and realizing
that the team doesn't exist

86
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,699
or that the sport doesn't exist.

87
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,314
I should have known. Poopball?

88
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,571
Man, I know how you feel.
Third wheel.

89
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,513
I have been the third wheel
so many times in my life.

90
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,648
My mom told me something once
that made me feel {\a lot }better. She said...

91
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:32,723
the third wheel
is what makes it a tricycle.

92
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,566
- What are you talking about?
- {\I am talking about }Your group date with Megan and Eric.

93
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,319
At Tink's?
How'd you know about that?

94
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,037
Did Stanley tell you?

95
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,823
Stanley was on your group date?

96
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,744
No, Stanley was with his wife.
I waved at him but he didn't wave back.

97
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,326
Does anybody else know about this?

98
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,161
There he goes.

99
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:02,955
So what is the scuttlebutt?
Anybody hear anything?

100
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:06,095
Nothing?

101
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,428
I got a little something-something.

102
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:11,333
- I don't know if I should say.
- So just keep it to yourself then.

103
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,686
Stanley is having a midlife crisis.

104
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,758
Stanley is way past
the middle of his life,

105
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,690
{\especially }considering
his height to weight ratio.

106
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,234
Apparently he and his wife

107
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:23,029
were out dancing
at a club for young people.

108
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,697
Teri's out of town.

109
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,849
- Who?
- Stanley's wife, Teri.

110
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:29,661
She's at an interior decorating expo
in Philly.

111
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,657
And Stanley hates crowds,
kids, and music.

112
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,307
I think you should check your facts.

113
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,260
You stupid son of a bitch.
You set me up.

114
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,304
- What are you talking about?
- Stanley's wife is out of town.

115
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,493
- He was with somebody.
- {\He was }Definitely{\ with someone}.

116
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,873
Was he? Who, his sister?

117
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:55,353
I don't get it!

118
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,368
If that was his sister,
then what they were doing was{\ totally } illegal.

119
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:00,858
Drugs?

120
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,533
Making out.

121
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,131
No, it's okay.

122
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:19,168
Never mind. Carry on.

123
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,236
Stanley is having an affair.

124
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,505
- What?
- I know.

125
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,405
I am very happy right now,

126
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,030
thrilled perhaps,

127
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,387
to be a part of the office,
to be a part of the conversation.

128
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,966
When you have somebody's attention
and their eyes are lighting up

129
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,834
because they are very interested
in what you have to say,

130
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,443
that is a great feeling
and I experienced that firsthand today.

131
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:42,692
It is wonderful
to be the center of attention.

132
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,057
That and that are the same letter.

133
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:46,182
"Q".

134
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,610
He's holding a pencil.

135
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,244
He could be doing a crossword puzzle
with that pencil.

136
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,832
What's that letter right there?
Same letter here and here.

137
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,750
- What haven't you guessed?
- "T".

138
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,076
"T", yes!

139
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,613
That is a "t"

140
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:06,038
and there's another one right there.

141
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,760
Just sound that out.
You're almost there.

142
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,930
Where you going, big guy?
Up to no good?

143
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,099
I'm meeting a client.
Do you have a problem{\ with that}?

144
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:19,466
I just had a quick question for you.
I'm casting

145
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:22,346
a movie and I'm looking
for a woman who can dance.

146
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,526
Beautiful woman.
Do you know anybody?

147
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,568
Good-bye.

148
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:27,155
Pays $5 million.

149
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:28,853
Nudity required.

150
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,406
You have to stop this.

151
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,533
Did you hear?
Stanley's having an affair.

152
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:35,203
I did from you.
You got to stop telling people.

153
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,392
Okay, I get it.

154
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:38,793
You feel out of the loop
and {\you feel }sorry for yourself

155
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,250
and it's really sad,
{\because }everybody thinks you're a loser.

156
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,378
Do you even know if it's true?
Do you have any idea? Because...

157
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,297
you might be ruining his life.

158
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:53,582
Hold up! Hold up!

159
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,184
Time to stop being polite
and get real.

160
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:00,913
You having an affair?

161
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:05,659
That is ridiculous. Of course not.
Why would you think that?

162
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:07,134
So it's not true.

163
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:14,659
Those interns. They told me
they saw you at the club

164
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,977
and they all said it was you.
It was clearly just...

165
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:20,985
racial profiling gossip.

166
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,767
- The little...
- Damn!

167
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:27,171
- Told her it was a stupid idea{\to go up in that club}.
- That's so stupid.

168
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,856
It's just that...

169
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:32,677
- Teri's been traveling a lot lately.
- I know.

170
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,079
- It's been lonely.
- I bet.

171
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,431
Cynthia's been keeping me company.

172
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,067
She was my nurse

173
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:41,142
when I was in rehabilitation.

174
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,605
We used to go on these long walks
on the treadmill.

175
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,318
I didn't intend...

176
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:49,793
Wait, wait, wait.

177
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:53,156
So it is true?

178
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,954
But I'm going to go break it off.

179
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,368
That's where I'm headed right now,
I swear.

180
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,836
Wait a second.
Do people often say they're going

181
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,229
on sales calls
and then go someplace else?

182
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:03,374
{\'cause }That's not cool.

183
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:07,485
I just need you to promise
not to say a word about this to anyone.

184
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:09,714
Michael, please.

185
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,925
- I'm not saying a damn thing.
- I'm counting on you, Michael.

186
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:14,998
You can count on me.

187
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,346
That smells good.

188
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:24,544
I might have extra.
It just depends on how many I eat.

189
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:26,713
Did you hear about Angela?
That's {\pretty }weird.

190
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,300
{\pos(192,240)}What do you mean exactly?

191
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:33,088
{\pos(192,240)}The fact
that she apparently is dating

192
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,233
{\pos(192,240)}an 81-year-old billionaire

193
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,557
{\pos(192,240)}who owns a Quiznos on the turnpike.

194
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:38,850
{\pos(192,240)}Really?

195
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:41,827
{\pos(192,240)}Right?

196
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:44,057
{\pos(192,240)}How do you untell something?

197
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:45,182
You can't.

198
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:48,192
You can't put words
back in your mouth.

199
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:49,567
What you can do

200
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,568
is spread false gossip

201
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,827
so that people think that everything
that's been said is untrue,

202
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:59,402
including
Stanley is having an affair.

203
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:05,018
<i>It's like the end of Spartacus.
I've seen that movie half a dozen times</i>

204
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,822
and I still don't know
who the real Spartacus is.

205
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:11,597
And that is what makes
that movie a classic whodunit.

206
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:15,386
Kelly has an eating disorder.
She always eats my lunch.

207
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:17,190
Anorexia. She's ana...

208
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,765
She's an "anorexitec."

209
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,213
- We should do something.
- Nothing can be done.

210
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:23,878
Just have to tell everybody
and hope for the best, I guess.

211
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,731
I'm worried about Erin

212
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:30,670
because she's not a very good worker.
I don't know how long she's gonna last{\ here}.

213
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:31,795
Really?

214
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:33,759
So...

215
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:34,934
And Andy...

216
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:36,123
is gay.

217
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,827
Did you hear Pam is pregnant?

218
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:42,372
Really?

219
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,134
She's gonna hate being a mom.

220
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,175
What?

221
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:55,343
Tea.

222
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,552
- So?
- You would.

223
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:59,223
I like tea.

224
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,483
I bet you like it.

225
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:04,907
I like it a lot.

226
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,359
I love tea.

227
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:09,649
Do you like it as much
as you like men's butts?

228
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:10,618
What?

229
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:12,655
'Cause you're gay.

230
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:16,043
Who told you that?

231
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:18,157
Was it Broccoli Rob?

232
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:20,398
Someone from Chi Psi?

233
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,507
Did you run
in someone from my high school?

234
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,996
This is not the first time

235
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:26,664
rumors about me being gay
have come up.

236
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:28,685
Twice before, actually.

237
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,316
Just a weird coincidence.

238
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,345
It's a little too weird.

239
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:40,583
Almost makes you wonder
if it's not a coincidence at all.

240
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:42,747
Which it is, of course.

241
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:45,948
But it makes you wonder.

242
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,766
Did you hear the rumor about me?

243
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:50,715
That I'm gay?

244
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:51,824
I did.

245
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:54,098
And?

246
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:55,661
What?

247
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:00,035
Do you think it's true?
Do you think that I'm...

248
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,242
gay?

249
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,869
Are you attracted to other men?

250
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,834
Let me kick you a scenario.

251
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:12,079
I'm at, like, a beach cabana

252
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:14,255
and Brad Pitt approaches,

253
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,373
tries to lean in and kiss me.

254
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:20,367
I would definitely resist,

255
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:21,634
like, at first.

256
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,006
But if he was persistent,

257
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,026
I might...

258
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:29,270
give in a little bit
to just really see what it felt like.

259
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:31,664
Would I push him away?

260
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:32,789
How hard?

261
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:35,777
Like, what if he's,
like, really aggressive?

262
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:38,575
If you resisted Brad Pitt
a little bit,

263
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,050
he would still...

264
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:43,345
- need to get to you?
- This is not real Brad Pitt.

265
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,056
This is, like, in my...
This is my fantasy.

266
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,839
Or it's, like, not fantasy.
It's, like, what I'm...

267
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:50,124
It's a scenario.

268
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:54,096
I wish I could help you. I don't...

269
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,379
You might be gay.

270
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:57,134
You might be gay.

271
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,582
What exactly
is my responsibility here?

272
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:04,203
To comfort
insecure heterosexual men?

273
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:06,349
That can't possibly fall to me.

274
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,017
- How far {\along }is Pam?
- A few months.

275
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:10,484
That's why
they're rushing the wedding.

276
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,360
You can't believe
everything you hear.

277
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:14,485
Like Stanley having an affair.

278
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,961
That is crazy.

279
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:17,993
Just there's no stock in it.

280
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:20,129
It's a weird day for false facts.

281
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:21,113
Let it go.

282
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:22,754
OK, everybody.

283
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:25,701
Big day. Last day for our interns.

284
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,411
Lot of other stuff.

285
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,823
Who knows what to believe?

286
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,893
Dwight, the honors.

287
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:35,586
Present these
to the dean for credit.

288
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:37,983
And as a gift,
I've attached my card.

289
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,007
Call me anytime of the day or night.

290
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,096
Why would we call you at night?

291
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:45,227
Now you can't call me at all,
so problem solved.

292
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:48,530
You {\'re gonna}will regret {\that }when you find yourself
between a moose and her cubs{\ at night}.

293
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,810
Look to the intern on your left.

294
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,282
Now to your right.

295
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:54,494
One of you will do
exceedingly well in business.

296
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:56,316
Just unlimited potential.

297
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:59,704
One of you will make a living
and nothing more.

298
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:01,402
And one of you

299
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,528
will make a great mother.

300
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,268
It's up to you
to choose which you want to be.

301
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,451
I am so happy you're eating again.

302
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:13,576
Me too.

303
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,419
Dude, how come you never try
to set me up?

304
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:19,755
I don't really do that.
Pam might have some friends though.

305
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:21,123
Women friends?

306
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:22,878
Not guy friends?

307
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:25,553
Are you interested
in her guy friends?

308
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:28,828
For the record, I prefer women.

309
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,267
But off the record,
I'm kind of confused.

310
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:32,894
Really?

311
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:34,945
The evidence is {\sort of }stacked against me,

312
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,105
I feel like.

313
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:39,442
- You got to figure this out.
- Yeah, right? How?

314
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,318
You got to have sex with a woman.

315
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,780
- Right-o.
- And then a man and then compare.

316
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:48,977
All right.

317
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,307
- Congratulations to you.
- On what?

318
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Come on.

319
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:55,991
Little baby tuna.

320
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:58,650
Little junior toro.

321
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:04,900
A baby conceived out of wedlock
is still a bastard.

322
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:06,344
What?

323
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:08,179
Want me to say it again?

324
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:10,598
- Why did that come into your brain?
- Can I talk to you?

325
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:14,393
So they know.

326
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:16,812
- Who did you tell?
- I didn't tell anyone. And you?

327
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,967
Nobody.

328
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:21,759
Did one of you tell Stanley
that I have asthma, 'cause I don't.

329
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:24,362
If it gets out,
they won't let me scuba.

330
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,880
If I can't scuba,

331
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:29,450
then what's this all been about?
What am I working toward?

332
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:30,409
What?

333
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,217
You think I'm the voice
of the Taco Bell Dog?

334
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:35,289
What are you talking about?

335
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:37,897
I have a daughter.
How could I be a virgin?

336
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:41,295
Has everyone heard
a crazy rumor about themselves today?

337
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,894
You know what?
Let's discredit these rumors.

338
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:47,176
Sure, but who's been saying
all that stuff?

339
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:50,554
That's not important,
{\I just think }We shouldn't listen to {\any of }this crap.

340
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:52,431
We should get to the bottom of this.

341
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,433
Let's pick a rumor
and trace it back{\to the beginning}.

342
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,301
I need to do mine first.

343
00:15:56,641 --> 00:16:00,244
Who's been saying that
there's another person inside of me

344
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,505
working me with controls?

345
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:04,652
I heard that from Andy.

346
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:06,698
I heard it from Erin.

347
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:09,337
I heard it from Michael.

348
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,115
He's over here!

349
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:20,039
- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

350
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,651
You told people
that I use store-bought manure

351
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,721
when I showed you
where my manure comes from.

352
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,725
{\pos(192,240)}- Don't get on it.
- Michael, don't.

353
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:39,303
{\pos(192,240)}Don't get on.

354
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:40,729
{\pos(192,240)}Do not.

355
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,522
{\pos(192,240)}- Stay, Michael.
- Step away.

356
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:44,944
{\pos(192,240)}Come on, boss.

357
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,219
{\pos(192,240)}Okay, I made it all up.

358
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:50,314
{\pos(192,240)}What?

359
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,364
Even the fact that I'm gay?

360
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:56,059
But, guys, I'm a victim here too.

361
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:59,329
People have been saying
that I am a J. Crew model.

362
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:01,290
No, we heard that about Jim.

363
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,263
I spread the rumor
that somebody was a J. Crew model

364
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:06,962
and I was referring to myself.

365
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,537
- How is that a bad rumor?
- 'Cause people think that models,

366
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,814
even though they're very attractive
are somewhat vapid.

367
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:15,637
It set our industry back
quite a bit.

368
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,140
Michael, why?
Why say all these things?

369
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:21,069
Why make up an eating disorder,
Stanley's affair,

370
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:22,643
me being a spokes dog?

371
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:25,022
You told everyone
I was having an affair?

372
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,609
Here's the thing.

373
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:29,683
There was one true rumor
out there today.

374
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:32,199
I didn't want everybody
to know what it was,

375
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:35,741
so all of you are off the hook
except for this one person.

376
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,884
Well, then
what's the one true rumor?

377
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,709
We have a right to know.

378
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:41,923
Am I gay?

379
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,789
The one true rumor...

380
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,414
This is gonna ruin
this person's life, is...

381
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,793
That Pam's pregnant.

382
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:50,718
- I knew it.
- I knew it.

383
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:53,550
Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger.

384
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,089
At first I thought,

385
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,422
she has a new bra with padding.

386
00:17:57,547 --> 00:18:01,045
But then I thought,
Pam doesn't need padding.

387
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,535
It just didn't add up, Jim.

388
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,666
- Congratulations.
- That's really great{\, you guys}.

389
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,524
- Don't vaccinate it.
- Who's the father?

390
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,182
- How far along?
- Four months.

391
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,877
- Who's the ob-gyn?
- Stop.

392
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:14,421
All right, you know...

393
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,313
This is not the truth

394
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:18,561
and you can't fall
on a sword this way.

395
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:20,953
The real thing
is that Stanley Hudson

396
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,292
had an affair.

397
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:27,403
Thank you to defend us, but actually,
Pam is pregnant and we can prove it.

398
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,578
If you would like to see proof.

399
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,715
- Just gonna wait for her?
- What's the "proof" mean?

400
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:39,762
- There it is!
- It's true!

401
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,858
Look at that!

402
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,939
That is the inside of your vagina.

403
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,854
That's not how it works, but...

404
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,764
It's clear
why we were trying not to tell people.

405
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,277
That's clear now.

406
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:59,728
How long have you known
about the pregnancy?

407
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,860
A week? Month?

408
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:03,787
A year?

409
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,540
We only told our parents last week.

410
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,931
- Did you pee on a stick?
- I did.

411
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,669
But it was inconclusive.

412
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:12,546
You should have told me.

413
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:15,825
You're right.

414
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:18,927
We should have realized
that you are an equal part of this.

415
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:24,941
<i>Michael, Teri Hudson
returning your call.</i>

416
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:27,144
You called Stanley's wife?

417
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,962
A long time ago.
Just to make sure she was out of town.

418
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,692
- God.
- Don't take it.

419
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,624
I have to take it
or it'll seem suspicious.

420
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:38,010
If you talk to her,
you're gonna tell her{\ about Stanley}

421
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,699
- and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
- I can do this.

422
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,753
- You can't do this.
- I can. I am going to tell her

423
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:47,146
that I need to redecorate my condo
and I need her help.

424
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,075
We will haggle about money
and I will back down

425
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,420
and then I won't talk to her
until this Cynthia thing's blown over.

426
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:55,503
- Sounds terrible.
- Please don't.

427
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:57,440
What up, Cynthia?

428
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:06,521
Just hang on a second, Cynthia.

429
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:18,721
It turns out
that Teri was already suspicious

430
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,095
because she had caught Stanley

431
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,988
and Cynthia a few months ago.

432
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,739
So Stanley promised

433
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,245
that he would stop and he did.

434
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,920
End of story. Well...

435
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,701
not exactly.

436
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:33,669
Cynthia kept calling him.

437
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:36,422
She would not stop calling him
and she was in love with him.

438
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:37,464
And get this.

439
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:39,232
Cynthia? Also married.

440
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:40,616
So...

441
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,790
you can't stop love, I guess.

442
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:45,660
And quite frankly,

443
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:48,285
I don't think
you should ever even try.

444
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:54,255
{\pos(192,210)}I learned that a company
can describe an internship

445
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,530
{\pos(192,210)} as full of exciting experiences,

446
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:58,622
{\pos(192,210)}even if that's a lie.

447
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:00,361
{\pos(192,210)}There's no regulation.

448
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,602
{\pos(192,210)}I learned that half
these people's email password

449
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:03,927
{\pos(192,210)}is "password."

450
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:07,377
{\pos(192,210)}I learned that a ream of paper
is 300 sheets.

451
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:09,052
{\pos(192,210)}I thought it was 500.

452
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,461
{\pos(192,210)}I guess I didn't learn anything.

453
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:17,339
{\pos(192,210)}I learned that if you look
even the tiniest bit like Jet Li

454
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:20,781
{\pos(192,210)} Michael will call you
Jet Li all summer.

455
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,101
{\pos(192,210)}- Julia Stiles.
- Alan Thicke.
