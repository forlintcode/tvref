1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,069
- Attention, everyone!
Jim and I, on behalf of...

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,738
- Too loud.
- The party planning committee,

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,206
- Too too loud, too loud.
- Have an annou--

4
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:07,741
But effective. Look.

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,209
On behalf
of jim and I,

6
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:11,554
Merry christmas.

7
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:13,470
All: Merry christmas.

8
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:14,709
- Good.

9
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:18,208
- My diabolical plot
is on hold for christmas.

10
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:23,475
My heart just melts with
the sound of children singing.

11
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:25,242
[snickers]

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,114
Not really.

13
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:29,186
I'm just tired.
The days are short.

14
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:31,657
I don't know.
Maybe I'm depressed.

15
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,765
It is time
to unveil the tree.

16
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,336
- Hey, rockefeller center.
- Yeah.

17
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:37,706
- Uh, I've actually
been to rock center,

18
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:38,710
And this is
nothing like that.

19
00:00:38,778 --> 00:00:39,744
- This is all we have.

20
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:42,217
- Ugh.
- Nope, it's not "ugh."

21
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:45,286
It is office camaraderie.
- It is warm feelings.

22
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:47,021
- Why don't we talk more about
it instead of doing it?

23
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,957
- 30, 29, 28...

24
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,659
- Why would you start so high?
- 27...

25
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:53,560
- 3, 2, 1...
- 26...

26
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:54,594
- Ooh.
- Ah.

27
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:57,029
- You didn't decorate it.

28
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,131
- No, exactly.
- We didn't, because we think

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,299
It would be better
to do it together.

30
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:01,299
- Everyone.

31
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,134
- Why would you wrap it
in a sheet

32
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:04,302
If you're not covering
anything up?

33
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:05,902
- Is--is it fake?

34
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,270
- Pam.
- Yes!

35
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:10,440
We are unveiling
an artificial tree.

36
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:12,411
That will never die...
- Yes.

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,246
- Like the spirit
of christmas.

38
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:15,649
- And we're supposed
to applaud you

39
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:17,918
For you taking a giant diaper
off a fake tree?

40
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:19,554
- This was
a successful unveiling.

41
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,889
Go back to work!

42
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:22,559
Merry christmas.

43
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:46,191
- Hello. Sorry, guys.
Sorry, guys.

44
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,226
I'm not sure
I've earned the right

45
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:49,561
To make announcements yet,

46
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,331
But whoever is giving me
the twelve days of christmas

47
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,734
As my secret santa,

48
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:55,102
Please stop.

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,138
I can't take it anymore.

50
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:59,540
My cat killed
a turtledove.

51
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:01,944
The french hens have started
pulling out my hair

52
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,079
To make a nest.

53
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:04,914
Please stop.

54
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:09,218
- What psycho
would send that as a gift?

55
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:11,821
- I begged dwight and jim

56
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:13,689
To give me erin
for secret santa.

57
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:15,825
And I decided to give erin
the twelve days of christmas.

58
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:17,526
Bowtie time.
[birds honking]

59
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,428
Is it my fault
that the first eight days

60
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:21,830
There's basically
30 birds?

61
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:25,867
- Ho, ho, ho!
Merry christmas, boys and girls.

62
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:28,403
It's me, santa claus.

63
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,672
- Hey, santa.

64
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,509
- They finally let you do it.
- Congrats, phyl.

65
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:33,710
- It's so edgy.

66
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,580
- I have been wanting
to be santa for years.

67
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,349
I believe I have
the right temperament

68
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,151
And the figure
to do the job well.

69
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,721
I slipped a note to jim
11 weeks ago,

70
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,290
And he said I could do it.

71
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:46,726
[giggles]

72
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:50,597
[tearfully] oh...It's been
a long journey...

73
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:55,471
But...[sniffles]
I'm santa claus!

74
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:58,541
- So, santa, what can we
expect from this party?

75
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,276
- It's going to be
a very jolly time

76
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,312
If you've been good.
- What if you've been bad?

77
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,081
- Oh, then nothing but
a lump of coal for you.

78
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:06,750
- What if you've been
really, really bad?

79
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,419
More "evil"
than strictly "wrong."

80
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:13,124
- Hey, creed, we covered it.
Lump of coal.

81
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,492
- For the past several weeks,

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,295
My secret santa has been
giving me pieces of a machine

83
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,831
That I've been attempting
to assemble.

84
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,399
I'm suspicious of this,

85
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,303
Because I had
the exact same idea

86
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,539
For catching osama bin laden.

87
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:28,709
I would simply send him
a different piece each day.

88
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:30,778
He would assemble it

89
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:35,150
To find himself...
In jail!

90
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,219
- You know, oscar, every time
I make this lasagna,

91
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:39,554
People ask me
if it's a family recipe.

92
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:43,726
But really...I just get
the recipe from the box.

93
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,594
- That's funny.

94
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:47,530
- Is it funny?
I thought it was more...

95
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,566
Interesting than funny.

96
00:03:54,238 --> 00:03:56,807
I think my water just broke.

97
00:03:56,874 --> 00:04:00,243
- That's too funny.
- Oscar and the warehouse guy.

98
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,512
Go, oscar!

99
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,447
Go, gay warehouse guy!

100
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:07,651
- Here's...Santa!

101
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:10,954
Hey, little girl, what would
you like for christmas?

102
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:14,558
Ooh! You have been
a very naughty girl, I see.

103
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:16,961
- Michael, we already
have a santa--phyllis.

104
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:21,131
- What the hell is going on?

105
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,500
Phyllis, jim?
Phyllis is santa.

106
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:24,835
- Yeah.
- Phyllis.

107
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:26,303
- Yeah. I told her a long
time ago she could do it.

108
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:27,771
- Take it back.
That is absurd.

109
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,306
- No. I'm not gonna do that.
- No--no!

110
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:30,407
Jim, come on!

111
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:31,541
- I think she'll
do a good job.

112
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:32,842
- It's insane!
A woman santa?

113
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,278
Where does it stop?
No!

114
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:37,981
Jim, this may be the last
christmas that we have here.

115
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,717
Doesn't it make you
a tiny bit anxious

116
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:43,320
Me not playing santa?
Come on!

117
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:46,056
- I'm not gonna go tell phyllis
that she can't be santa.

118
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:48,092
- Fine. Then do it
anonymously.

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,861
Ransom note style.
You can...

120
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,329
You know what?

121
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:53,665
I have a bunch of letters
cut out of magazines in my desk.

122
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:54,900
You can use those.

123
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:56,435
If this were russia, yeah.

124
00:04:56,503 --> 00:04:58,037
Sure, everybody
would go to one santa.

125
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:59,539
And there would be
a line around the block,

126
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,140
And once you sat on her lap

127
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,843
And she asked you
what you wanted,

128
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,878
You would say,
probably, "freedom"...

129
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:06,747
At which point the kgb
would arrest you

130
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:08,515
And send you to siberia.

131
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,651
It's a good thing russia
doesn't exist anymore.

132
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,019
Ho, ho, ho!

133
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,555
Ho, ho, ho!

134
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:20,626
Why pay more to sit next
to old tranny claus over there

135
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:22,628
When you can sit on my lap?

136
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:26,131
Phyllis is only pretending
to be a man.

137
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,632
I'm the real thing!

138
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,435
Sit down on my lap,
and there will be no doubt!

139
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:32,671
[overlapping disgusted comments]

140
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:34,373
No, it's not,
like, penis-wise.

141
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,975
Hello, little boy!
What's your name?

142
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:38,810
- Michael, it's me, kevin.

143
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:41,212
Phyllis says
I'm too big for her lap.

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,282
- Oh, I am so sorry
that phyllis hates you

145
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,284
And hates your body.

146
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:50,154
But santa
remembers a reindeer

147
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:53,357
That was just a tiny bit
different as well.

148
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:55,125
- When can I sit on your lap?
- Right now!

149
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:58,462
Come on over here, big boy!

150
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,630
There we go!

151
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,132
[quietly] oh, my god.

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,133
[grunts]

153
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,068
- It's really comfortable.

154
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,571
- [gasping]

155
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,541
[strained] what would you
like for christmas, little boy?

156
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,576
[panting]

157
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:12,845
- I don't know.

158
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:14,980
I-I didn't know
you were gonna ask me that.

159
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,517
- Well, what did you think
was going to happen?

160
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,052
- I didn't know.

161
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,888
Nobody's ever let me sit
on their lap before.

162
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:25,192
- [wheezily] all right,
just say some toys, please.

163
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,659
- Can you give me
some choices?

164
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:28,661
'cause I really don't wanna
mess up on this list.

165
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,596
- [quietly] damn it, kevin.
Come on.

166
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:34,266
<i>- What about if I tell you
the things I don't want?</i>

167
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:35,333
- Okay--get off!
Get off!

168
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,501
Off!

169
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:39,137
[groans]
oh, jee--god!

170
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:41,238
- I didn't even get to tell you
what I wanted.

171
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,806
- Okay, you know what
you get?

172
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,841
You get a thousand
helium balloons attached to you

173
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,842
So santa doesn't have
to go through this again.

174
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,812
[moaning] oh!
- Awesome.

175
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,281
- Well?
- I'm trying, phyllis.

176
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:54,183
You're santa.
- The only santa.

177
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:55,217
- That's what I want.

178
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,052
- You promised me this.

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,654
Don't make me get bob
involved.

180
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:01,056
- What would bob do?
- Never mind.

181
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:03,326
I shouldn't have said that.

182
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:04,527
- Does it hurt?

183
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:06,262
- It stings a lot.
- Ehh.

184
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,265
- I keep trying to figure out
who's sending me these gifts.

185
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,666
- I know, right?

186
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,269
- So far,
no one will admit to it.

187
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:16,271
Is it you?

188
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:18,940
- [laughs] yeah!

189
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,609
[both chuckling]

190
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:23,011
Totally.
I admit it.

191
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,946
It's me.
- Oh. Seriously?

192
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,680
- Seriously?

193
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:29,116
[chuckling] are you serious?
- Is--what--you--

194
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:31,351
- Yeah.
Totally serious.

195
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,953
I'm your secret santa.

196
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,488
Busted!
- [laughing]

197
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,924
- There he is.
- Hey, man.

198
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,892
- Is matt around?
I've got his check.

199
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,326
- Uh, matt is on a delivery.

200
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,528
Just leave it here.
I'll take it.

201
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,765
- Ah. I'll just...
[laughs] wait for him.

202
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,900
- Matt's a pretty good-lookin'
dude, don't you think?

203
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,502
- I'll just leave it
here with ya.

204
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,274
[overlapping chatter]

205
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,475
- What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

206
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,976
- Come here!
- I'm doing something here.

207
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,580
- Come on! Ah...
Ho, ho, ho!

208
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,348
Come on, I need this.
Come over here!

209
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,117
- What are you talking--
- just sit down.

210
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,585
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Is everything okay?

211
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,554
- Yep. Yeah. Ryan and I
are just having some fun.

212
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,322
- Can I just talk to you
for a second?

213
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,123
- Whoop!
Okay, what?

214
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,525
- You can't yell out,
"I need this, I need this,"

215
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,127
As you pin down an employee
on your lap.

216
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,563
-  Okay. You know what, jim?

217
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,065
With two santas in the room,
things get ruthless.

218
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,467
- Yeah.
- Do you understand?

219
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,469
You forced my hand.
- Okay. Michael, it's phyllis.

220
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,138
<i>We want phyllis as santa.
- Oh, do we? Do we?</i>

221
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,441
<i>Is that what we want?
Why don't we take a vote on it?</i>

222
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,110
- Great.
- Hey! Okay, everybody.

223
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,511
The office
is being pulled apart.

224
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,979
I realize that.

225
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,316
There are traditions
at stake.

226
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,517
And there are women--
- who wants phyllis as santa?

227
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,552
- No, no, no!

228
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,620
Wait! No!
There are other choices.

229
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,989
There's information that we--
are you kidding me, kevin?

230
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,158
After you almost killed me?

231
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,494
- Michael, I had you.
I just wanna try phyllis.

232
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:54,599
- And if you want michael
as santa, raise your hand.

233
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,933
Can I get you some punch?
- I--no.

234
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:59,437
I'll get some punch.

235
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:02,672
- Oh!
- Michael!

236
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,963
- Excuse me.

237
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:08,599
Whoever has been sending me
the parts to this gun,

238
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,936
I think you sent me a gear
instead of a trigger.

239
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,637
- How do you know
it's a gun?

240
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:15,841
- What else
does it look like?

241
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:17,710
- Not a gun.

242
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,779
- Well, I don't have
all the pieces yet.

243
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:22,281
- Well, unless the missing
pieces is a gun,

244
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:24,383
You don't have a gun.

245
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:25,384
[thud]

246
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:28,587
Not a gun.

247
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:30,772
- In the north pole,
I spend many nights alone

248
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,707
Tinkering with toys.

249
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:35,911
So today,
let's put a twinkle

250
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:39,148
In old kris kringle's eye.

251
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:41,484
Let the party begin!

252
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:44,087
- Whoa!

253
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:45,155
- Yay!

254
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:48,793
- I don't ask for much
from christmas.

255
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,394
I really don't.

256
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:52,663
It's not like I am begging
people to...

257
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:55,533
Buy me diamonds and...

258
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:58,269
Brooch pendants.

259
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:00,271
Oh, buy me something
expensive,

260
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,872
Or I'm gonna kill myself.

261
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,307
That's not...

262
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,875
I don't care about that!

263
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:07,077
All I wanna be is santa.

264
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:10,880
And...You want to take
that away from me, fine.

265
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:12,615
Go ahead.

266
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:15,751
But when you need my help
because I am ruining everything,

267
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,220
Don't look at me!

268
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:23,693
- Behold...

269
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,696
Jesus christ.

270
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:27,531
And I bring to you...

271
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,500
Glad christmas tidings.

272
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,168
I want to remind everyone

273
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:33,838
The true meaning
of christmas.

274
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,874
Those of you
who wish to join me,

275
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:38,476
That's great,
I am excited by that.

276
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:41,412
And those of you who don't,
I forgive you.

277
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,747
But I never forget.
- Oh, wow, michael.

278
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:46,416
This must be obvious
how wrong this is.

279
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:48,251
- Oh...The antichrist.

280
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,352
- Okay, you can't--
- sss!

281
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,320
- Ow! Look--
you cannot push religion.

282
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:52,988
- Oh, but I can push drugs
in here.

283
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:54,423
Is that what you're saying?
- No! You--

284
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,058
- Well, you have to pick
one or the other.

285
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,126
Your choice.
Pick your poison.

286
00:10:58,194 --> 00:10:59,762
Get back to me.
In the meantime...

287
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:01,964
I am going to spread
my goodness

288
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,866
All over this company!

289
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,869
- Hey, phyllis?

290
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:10,307
Could you not reveal to erin
that I'm her secret santa?

291
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,843
- All right, sweetie, I'll just
tell her it's michael.

292
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:12,944
- Okay.

293
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,247
Together:
âª I saw three ships âª

294
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,483
âª come sailing in âª
- have you talked to him?

295
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,584
- What...

296
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,752
- Matt.

297
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,320
- Is it that obvious?

298
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,222
[mumbles indistinctly]

299
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,158
Oh...Hey.

300
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:29,728
- Mm. Good pate, right?

301
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:31,797
Oscar made it.

302
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:33,932
Have you met oscar?
- I don't think so.

303
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,334
Hey, oscar, come here.

304
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,602
[singing continues
in background]

305
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,438
- âª on christmas day
in the morning âª

306
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,107
Oscar, this is matt,

307
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:45,076
And, um, matt loves
your pate.

308
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:46,745
- I had some.

309
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:49,313
- Oscar's pate's great.

310
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,649
I could eat it all day,
every day.

311
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:54,518
Mm.

312
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:58,256
How come the good ones
are never straight, right?

313
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:00,425
- Okay, pam.
- Okay.

314
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:03,562
Yes. They're the only
two gay guys I know.

315
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:06,097
But they should be together.

316
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:07,332
- This just arrived

317
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,401
From the dunder mifflin
north pole branch.

318
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:10,936
- We don't have
a north pole branch.

319
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:12,437
Idiot!

320
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:15,006
- [sarcastic singsong]
uh-oh, what's dwight gonna get?

321
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:17,342
What is it?

322
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,677
- Yes!

323
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,779
- Oh, yes.
It's space garbage.

324
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:23,582
Dwight's gonna be able
to build himself a friend.

325
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,351
âª deck the halls
with crappy...âª

326
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,020
- And stanley, ho, ho, ho!

327
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:29,855
You've been very good
this year.

328
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,123
- I have.

329
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:33,292
- Yeah, except for
cheating on your wife.

330
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,195
Adultery's a sin.
Look it up in the bible, people.

331
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:38,797
What'd he get?
- He got scented candles.

332
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,599
- Oh.
Well, that's appropriate.

333
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,936
A lotta fire where you're going.
Better get used to it.

334
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,105
You're going to h-e-l-l,
double hockey sticks.

335
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:49,241
Goin' to hell, stanley.
- Amen.

336
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:52,544
- And this brings us
to you, little one.

337
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:53,979
- I can't see from here,
people.

338
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:56,582
Somebody shout it out.
Don't make me get up.

339
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,852
- It's fabric.
I really wanted this.

340
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,553
- That's fantastic!

341
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,089
You can make another dress
that goes past your feet.

342
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:06,692
- Andy, was this you?
- It's a secret.

343
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,927
- No, andy had...Erin.

344
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,462
- That--
- michael!

345
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,830
- You--

346
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:13,131
- What, was I not
supposed to say?

347
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,000
[click]
what--turn it back on.

348
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,968
- No.

349
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,743
- Yes, michael.
What is so urgent?

350
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:29,012
- David, guess who I am
sitting here dressed as.

351
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,413
- I'm not going to guess.

352
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,714
You can tell me,
or I will hang up.

353
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:34,851
- I will give you a hint.
His last name is christ.

354
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:37,186
He has the power of flight.

355
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:38,287
He can heal leopards.

356
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:40,322
- Michael--
- I am jesus, david.

357
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,225
And you know why?
Because phyllis, a woman,

358
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:45,360
Has "uslurped"
my role as santa.

359
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:48,730
- Michael, this is
a very, very bad time.

360
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:50,632
- Really?

361
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,667
What's going on?

362
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,268
- Stephanie, can you hop off,
please?

363
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,671
- Sure, david.
- What the hell?

364
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:59,440
How rude!
Does she do that all the time?

365
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:01,977
- Do you want me off
this call too, michael?

366
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:03,411
- Hey--what?
Get off!

367
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,614
Get off the phone!

368
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:07,750
- [david sighs]
listen...

369
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:10,620
I shouldn't tell you this,
but the company has a buyer.

370
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:12,922
The board will have no choice
but to approve,

371
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,625
And they are going
to clean house.

372
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:17,061
- What does that mean?

373
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:18,395
- I'll be fired.

374
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:21,332
- Well...Can't alan
protect you?

375
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,335
- Alan will be out too.
All of us.

376
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:25,570
Good-bye, michael.

377
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:27,872
- [quietly]
oh, my god.

378
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:32,311
- Earlier today,
this office needed a santa.

379
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,648
And then it needed
a second santa.

380
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:39,251
And then it needed a jesus.

381
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:43,622
Now, it needs
a michael.

382
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:48,160
And that's one suit
phyllis cannot fit into.

383
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:51,264
[low conversations]
- hey...

384
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,799
How's everybody doing?

385
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,300
- Not great.

386
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:56,136
You heckled santa
for an hour and a half.

387
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:57,638
- That was a different guy.
That was jesus.

388
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,174
Jesus sort of ruined
the party.

389
00:15:00,242 --> 00:15:01,775
Hurt, petulant jesus.

390
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:04,345
- Are you serious?
That is so offensive.

391
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:07,415
- You know what's
even more offensive...

392
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:10,751
Is bailing on this party
because some...

393
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:14,221
Jerk ruined
the first part of it.

394
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,357
Dwight, come here.
Here's my debit card.

395
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:18,859
I want you to go pick up
a bunch of pizzas

396
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:20,427
And meet me
in the conference room.

397
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:24,197
- What's your pin number?
- I...Don't want to say.

398
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:27,734
But it's fun to stay
at the...

399
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,736
âª it's fun to stay at the âª

400
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,804
- Where?
Holiday inn.

401
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,072
I don't--

402
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,342
- [humming]

403
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:41,481
- I-I thought that
you would like it.

404
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,150
- It was a little much,
andy.

405
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:46,187
- Well, it's the thought
that counts.

406
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:49,323
- What...Were you thinking?

407
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,161
- I suppose a gentleman
might throw in the towel

408
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:55,864
At this point.

409
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:58,267
Guess what.
Not gonna happen.

410
00:15:58,335 --> 00:15:59,502
- You know what,

411
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:02,305
Christmas isn't
about santa or jesus.

412
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:04,506
It's about the workplace.

413
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:07,076
All of you...
Feel like my family.

414
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:09,411
Ryan, you are my son,

415
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,147
And...

416
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:14,216
Pam, you're my wife,
and jim...

417
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:17,920
And angela and phyllis,
you are my...Grandmas.

418
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:22,791
And stanley,
you're...Our mailman.

419
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:23,958
And I can't help but look

420
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,660
At all your wonderful,
beautiful faces

421
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,495
And think, "how could they
do this to us?"

422
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:29,564
- How could who do what to us?
- [overlapping questions]

423
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,332
- That's--not--nothing--
- why--

424
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,733
- It's just...
- We deserve to know.

425
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,101
[overlapping comments]

426
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:35,568
- We're going out of business!
- What?

427
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:37,070
- What?
- You are kidding me.

428
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,738
- Wait, wait, wait.
Who said that?

429
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:41,607
- David told me on the phone.
- When did he tell you, today?

430
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,442
- Earlier today, he said...
- Oh!

431
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,312
- We have been sold.
All: What?

432
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,681
- Aah!
- Dwight!

433
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:51,584
- Come on!
- Michael, wait.

434
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:53,286
So they said we are sold.

435
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:55,521
- David is gone, alan is gone.
We're all gone.

436
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:57,023
- Okay, but we haven't
gone under.

437
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,792
We've been sold, and that can
mean many different things.

438
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:01,161
- It's hard for me
to imagine a scenario

439
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,796
Where meredith palmer
keeps her job,

440
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:04,431
And david wallace does not--
no offense, meredith.

441
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,832
- No, I get it.

442
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,768
- I'll call him.
I'll call david.

443
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:09,336
- No, you won't, because
he's not picking up his phone.

444
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:13,040
- Yes, I will, because I always
know how to get through to him.

445
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:15,109
He told me where
his kids go to school.

446
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:16,577
I call the school.

447
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,145
I tell them
I'm the pediatrician.

448
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:20,214
They patch me through
to his secretary.

449
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:23,717
I use my little girl voice.
Badda-bing, badda-boom.

450
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:26,454
- Hey, sweetie, what is it?
- It's not sweetie.

451
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:28,689
It's michael scott.
- What the hell--

452
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,425
- Stephanie, could you
hop off, please?

453
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:31,893
- Michael--[huffs]
I have never--

454
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:33,261
- David--
- never, ever--

455
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:35,397
- David, you are on speakerphone
with the entire branch

456
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:36,765
And the warehouse.

457
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,766
- Hi, david.
- Hey, david.

458
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,534
[overlapping greetings]

459
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:41,403
- Hi, everyone.

460
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,205
- David,
they do not believe me

461
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:46,209
When you told me
that everyone was canned.

462
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:48,511
- You weren't supposed
to tell anyone, michael.

463
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:49,913
- Well, I think
we're past that now.

464
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,481
- I am not supposed--

465
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:54,151
Okay, guys, I was really
only talking about

466
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:57,121
Alan, myself, and a few
other execs you don't know.

467
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,524
- Oh, my god, david,
that's...Horrible.

468
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,160
- How about us?
It's meredith.

469
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,496
By the way, your wife
is a very lucky woman.

470
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:07,966
- Look, they're buying the
company for the distribution.

471
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:10,435
You guys are the only thing
about this company that works.

472
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,872
So congratulations.
- We're not fired?

473
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,540
- No.
No, congratulations.

474
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:16,141
- All right!
- Yeah!

476
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,413
- It's a christmas miracle!

- Whoo-hoo!

âª but it's all to me

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,798
It's true.

484
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,467
We all walk alone
at some point.

00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:03,791
- Yeah. That was--
that was the idea.

00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,192
- Thank you.
- Awesome.

495
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,696
- Thanks, man.

- Oh! You got it?

500
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,942
- Ha ha!
- What is that?

501
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,844
- I have no idea.
- Huh...

502
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,313
- Well...

503
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,047
Maybe those'll help.

504
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:29,217
- Michael, please.
Come on.

505
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,852
- Sorry.

I can use this

00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:13,391
- I would like an xbox
and...

520
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:18,129
A tv that's compatible
with an xbox.

521
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:20,230
And I'm sorry.

522
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:22,466
- [exhales]

523
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,834
An xbox it is,

524
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:28,172
Because I've decided
you're a good boy.

525
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,674
- Scott.

526
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:31,309
What in the hell
is going on here?

527
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:33,011
- No, no, no.
- You called bob?

528
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,247
Phyllis!
- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

529
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:36,915
It's was earlier today.
- Okay.

530
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:38,818
- Hi, sweetheart.
- You okay, baby?

531
00:20:38,886 --> 00:20:40,453
- I'm good, baby.
- Oh, god.

532
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:41,655
Get a room, santas.

533
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:54,308
- Thank you, santa.

534
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:56,977
It's a little slippery
out here.

535
00:20:57,044 --> 00:20:59,880
[rhythmic sound approaches]

536
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:01,549
- Oh, my god.

537
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:03,418
- Twelve drummers drumming.

538
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,120
Merry Christmas, Aaron.

539
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:19,821
Sing it away, boys.
