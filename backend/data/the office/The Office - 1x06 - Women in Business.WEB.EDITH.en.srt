1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,520
-[Lloyd] Hey, Sebastian.
-What?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,680
Hey, do you have any adventurers
in your family?

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,640
-What?
-Any… any heroes?

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,840
Ah… no, I don't think so.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,400
-I do.
-Right.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,200
Well, TBC, you know.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,760
-To be confirmed.
-[printer beeps]

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,680
But I'm pretty sure
it's gonna be confirmed.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,480
-Yeah, uh…
-Yeah.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,640
-Cool, man. Uh…
-Keep you updated.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,440
You don't… you don't have to.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
I bought myself a genealogy test
for my birthday.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,360
Oh, hey, Carlie.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,440
Hey, do you have any adventurers
in your family?

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,120
My mate Craig Dodd got a test.
Turns out he's 2% Hispanic.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,200
Total game-changer.

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,640
Met a nice lady at a flamenco class.

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,360
Now, he's moving in with her,

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,880
and her, um,

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,000
her adult son.

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,480
I'll keep you updated.

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,880
Hey. Hey, Nick.

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
[theme music playing]

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,039
[roadway noise]

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,880
-[lift pings]
-[indistinct office chatter]

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,120
What is going on?

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
[mumbles] Good morning.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,800
-I need you to sign in, please.
-[Lizzie] Sorry.

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,720
Who are you
and why are you sitting at my desk?

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,039
I'm Dylan, the receptionist.

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,759
Uh, you're not.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,880
So, move,

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,560
before I call security,

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,600
which also happens to be me
so they'll be here instantly, yeah?

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,920
[tablet beeping]

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,280
[Lizzie] Actually, you know what?
I won't sign in,

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,680
-and if I find you here--
-[Hannah] Lizzie. Lizzie.

38
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,280
Can I… borrow you for a second?

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,759
Got a… got a surprise for you.

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,560
Last night, Alisha asked me
to submit an application

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
for Western Sydney
Businesswoman of the Year,

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,320
and, pfft.

43
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,640
I don't really care about awards.

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,080
I've always found the award
is in the reward

45
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,800
of having a happy staff that love you.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,280
I am not happy about this, Hannah.

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
Well, you might be happy about this.
I'm promoting you.

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,960
You are?

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,960
Yep. Promoting women
into positions of power.

50
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,760
That's my mantra, really.

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
I've never heard you say that.

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
I say it all the time.

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,680
And, ooh, my back hurts
from carrying all my sisters

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,600
all the time.

55
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,440
Ow. Pulled a muscle in my feminism.

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,320
I'm making you

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,560
my production manager.

58
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,920
[Lizzie] Wow.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,480
Yep, okay.

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,079
What am I Production Managering?

61
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,520
[Hannah] My award application.

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Just a sexy little upbeat video
highlighting all my best attributes.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,920
They want a sex video?

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
No, they just want a video.

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,280
[Lizzie] Done.

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,880
Sebastian's gonna make the video.

67
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
Why Sebastian?

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
[Hannah] 'Cause he's a cool guy
with a cool phone.

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,000
And we need a video that highlights me
as women supporting women, check,

70
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,360
and a passionate commitment to diversity.

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,840
[Lizzie laughing] Okay.

72
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,920
So that's why he's here.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,160
-Who?
-The security risk.

74
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,360
Dylan is here
because he's an excellent receptionist.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,280
[Lizzie] So, who do you want
in your video?

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,120
Oh, who do I want in my video?
I haven't really thought about it.

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
Um, top of my head, let's say,

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
Martin, Greta, Tina,

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,880
Dylan, Big D,

80
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,520
Sebastian,

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,960
and, I don't know,

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
Stevie from the warehouse?

83
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,200
So yeah, Hannah just pretty much listed
every diverse person in the office.

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Just off the top of her head, though.

85
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,640
[Lizzie] Who else have we got? We've got…

86
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,840
Deborah, Lloyd, um…

87
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,800
Me.

88
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,640
Yeah, I reckon we just stick to the list
that I gave you initially.

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
Yeah.

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,960
And I'll have a ham and cheese
tomato sandwich. [laughs]

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,240
[muttering]

92
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,680
Come on.

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Ugh!

94
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,840
[Deborah] Okay, attention, everybody.
We've got a problem.

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Does anyone know
why the coffee machine is not working?

96
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,680
Anybody?

97
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,640
[silence]

98
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,640
[Deborah] Marty?

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
No, no. No. No.

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,880
-[Deborah] Greta?
-Uh-uh.

101
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,959
Excuse me.

102
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,680
[Nick] Why are you doubting me?

103
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,480
I reckon I could pull off a kilt.

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,200
-So confident.
-My legs are long.

105
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,560
-[Greta] I mean, they are--
-Hey, guys.

106
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,640
[Hannah] Oh, Greta!

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
You know what I was thinking?

108
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,640
It's illegal how many good hair days
you get a week.

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,480
Yeah, I've issued her a number of fines.

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
Call my lawyer.

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,720
[laughs]

112
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,040
[Greta laughs, forced]

113
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
Do you need something…?

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
No. Ac-- well, you know what?

115
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Now that you've brought it up, um,

116
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,000
Alisha wants me to apply for this
women in business thing,

117
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,400
and she was wondering
if you could write a little testimonial

118
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,159
about how inspiring I am as a boss?

119
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,840
Her words, not mine.

120
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,280
So, if you could, I don't know,
maybe have that by this afternoon?

121
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,880
[Hannah] Hey, Teens.

122
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,840
How ya going?

123
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,720
You all excited
for your big, starring role

124
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,360
in my video this afternoon?

125
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,160
Um, not really.

126
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,760
-[indistinct office chatter]
-[keyboards clacking]

127
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,640
-[Deborah] What's up with you?
-Nothing.

128
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Just excited about
what the day might bring.

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,080
You've had coffee, haven't you?

130
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
-[Lloyd] No.
-Where'd you get it?

131
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,920
Today, I get to find out who I really am.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,880
Uh, no.

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,040
[Deborah] Not today Lloyd, not today.

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,040
[Lloyd] Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

135
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,840
I could be descended from adventurers
or heroic Spanish conquistadors

136
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
or kings, even.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,080
Imagine that.

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,120
"Hi! I…" No, that's too…

139
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Hi-- [clears throat]

140
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,520
-[in lower voice] Hi. Hi.
-"Hi."

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,800
Okay, yeah, that says…
that says "woman".

143
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,120
Should I say,
[in low voice] "Hi, I'm Hannah Howard,"

144
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,680
or should I say,

145
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,560
[in low voice] "Hi. Hannah Howard here."

146
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,440
"Hi. Hannah Howard here,"
has too many H's in a row.

147
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,720
That's a good point.

148
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Is the suit a bit much?

149
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,040
-Yes.
-[Hannah] Good. Good, good, good.

150
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
[clattering loudly]

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,480
-Now you've really broken it.
-It was broken.

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,760
So am I, son.

153
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,840
[mutters] So am I.

154
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,880
[Deborah] I've got
an addictive personality,

155
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,520
which stems back to my childhood.

156
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,920
My dad used to give me a lollipop

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,360
every time I went to the store
to get a pack of cigarettes.

158
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,560
For him, not for me.

159
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,960
I didn't smoke until I was…

160
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
eight?

161
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,040
[coffee machine clattering]

162
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,720
Have you tried turning it off
and turning it on again?

163
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,240
Yeah, it's not a computer, Tina.

164
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,280
Sorry, this…

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,920
We should try…

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,320
Try turning it off and on at the wall.

167
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
[Yohan] I didn't do anything.

168
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,400
But did you make it worse? Like,
is… is it totally stuffed now?

169
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,760
-I mean, it was already broken.
-[Deborah] Ugh!

170
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,240
[Deborah] Fuck!

171
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,720
[Deborah] But I heard it was you that
pulled the hose out.

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,240
-[Lizzie] Hannah?
-[Hannah] Ah, Lizzie.

173
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,600
-What's all that noise?
-[Lizzie] We have a problem.

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
The coffee machine is broken.

175
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,880
This is an office of addicts.

176
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,800
[Hannah] Helloha, everybody!

177
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,520
[dead silence]

178
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,440
Yeah, I-- I get it.

179
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,280
"Where's my goddamn coffee?"

180
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,600
Am I right?

181
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,760
Um, well,

182
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
I want you to know that
I am personally managing this crisis.

183
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,320
[Deborah] How?

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,040
By identifying options.

185
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,040
What are they?

186
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
Good question.

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,280
Lizzie, why don't you…?

188
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,560
I… uh…

189
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,440
Option one is the truck stop café
down the road.

190
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,920
Nah, that's worse than servo coffee.
What's option two?

191
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,000
The servo.
[all sign despondently]

192
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,800
Okay, I-- I want you to know
that I'm listening

193
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,200
and I hear you

194
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
and you need a third option.

195
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,480
We're going to have that
solved in the next hour.

196
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,720
-Aren't-- Am I right, Lizzie?
-Tick-tock!

197
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,080
[discontented muttering]

198
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,600
It's coming, guys. Don't worry.

199
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,720
And don't forget,
we're filming the video later!

200
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,760
Lizzie?

201
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
[softly] You need to sort this crisis
in the next hour, okay?

202
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,440
Whatever the cost.

203
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,400
[telephones ringing]

204
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
[notification chimes]

205
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,560
[Lloyd] 67% Anglo Saxon,

206
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,640
24% Celtic…

207
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,800
Oh.

208
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,240
…8% Germanic.

209
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,840
Just boring farmers,

210
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,760
not a hero or a Spanish conquistador
amongst them.

211
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,159
[female voice over laptop]
When on camera,

212
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,960
use physical actions
to punctuate your message.

213
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,200
[video stops playing]

214
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,120
Please tell me
the coffee crisis is sorted.

215
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,720
The coffee crisis is sorted.

216
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,080
-Oh. But is it actually?
-Yes.

217
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,080
-Oh, great.
-Do you want to know how I did it?

218
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,720
Oh, not at all. Thank you.

219
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,480
[machinery whirring]

220
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,880
-[man 1] Take it down.

221
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,320
[Stevie] Just need to ask him.

222
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,240
Oi, Jonny!

223
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
Wait a sec.

224
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,400
-What?
-These guys wanna use your coffee machine.

225
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,840
No way.

226
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,400
Told you. He doesn't let anyone
touch his coffee machine.

227
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Yeah, I agreed to sort out
the coffee situation

228
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,120
in exchange for Lizzie
writing Hannah's testimonial.

229
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,480
-Pretty happy about that.
-Mm.

230
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,680
And I agreed to help because I was bored.

231
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,800
I mean supportive.

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Okay, what if it's him touching it
but making coffees for us?

233
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,480
Maybe.

234
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,760
You guys would cover costs?

235
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,280
-So says Hannah.
-Yeah, I can vouch for that.

236
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,560
What do you reckon?

237
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,480
-Cash?
-Yeah.

238
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,640
-Café prices?
-Yeah.

239
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Sure.

240
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,640
He said sure.

241
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,320
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

242
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,560
-[Jonny] Have a good day.
-[Greta] Thank you.

243
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
[Jonny] No, mate,
I've got to unpack these.

244
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,000
[indistinct chatter]

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
Could I get a triple shot flat white?
Uh, now. As in, like, right now.

246
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Coming up.

247
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,200
-How much?
-No, they're free.

248
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,360
-I'm just gonna wait over here.
-All right.

249
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,120
-[Jonny] I'll bring it over.
-Great.

250
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,760
[Lloyd] Martin? Martin?

251
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,280
Martin?

252
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,280
Can I have a word?
It's a little bit sensitive.

253
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,640
Ah… is it work-related?

254
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,440
Ah, well, it's affecting my work, so yeah.

255
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,880
I need to apply
for some compassionate leave.

256
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,400
Oh, is someone in your family sick?

257
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,960
No, no. No, my family aren't anything.

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,200
-That's the problem.
-Right.

259
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,120
-My mate Craig's 2% Hispanic.
-Yeah?

260
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,720
And in real life,
I am way more interesting than he is.

261
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,400
-Yeah?
-And it's just not fair.

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
So can I just get
a little bit of time off?

263
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,800
-Um…
-Just to process it?

264
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,080
-No.
-[Lizzie] Okay everyone.

265
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,600
Coffee break over.

266
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,160
-Everybody upstairs now.
-[discontented murmuring]

267
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,720
What? I haven't got mine yet.

268
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,560
[Lizzie] Come on,
it's time to shoot Hannah's video.

269
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
-We'll be five minutes, Lizzie.

270
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,120
Hi. I'm Hannah Howard,

271
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,440
Managing Director at the Sydney branch

272
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,280
of packaging company Flinley Craddick.

273
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,520
And I'm a woman.

274
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,640
I've created a relaxed environment

275
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,520
where fun and productivity are
at the top of the agenda.

276
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,960
Call Stevie.

277
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,320
You know, I've been
at Flinley Craddick a long time,

278
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,640
but not nearly as long as Greta's people.

279
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,920
Here's to another 40,000 years.

280
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Seventy.

281
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,800
Hmm?

282
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
I've created an inclusive environment

283
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,760
where every size, colour, gender,
and abilities are welcome.

284
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,760
[mumbling] You have
an eleven o'clock meeting.

285
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,880
Thanks, Dylan.

286
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,080
-[laughs cheerily]
-[lift dings]

287
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,600
[Stevie clears throat]

288
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,560
[Hannah] Oh. Hi, Stevie.

289
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,280
You wanted to see me?

290
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,520
Yeah. I hope you don't mind that
we borrowed your flag.

291
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,040
That's not my flag.

292
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,240
Well, not yours, but your community's.

293
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,160
That's a lesbian flag.

294
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
It is.

295
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,680
Thank you.

296
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,760
I thought he was a lesbian.

297
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,600
[Lizzie] I thought so too
but maybe he's not.

298
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,120
[Sebastian] Do you want me to cut?

299
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Yes, c-- Yes, cut!

300
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm not doing The Voice.

301
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,080
[Hannah in video on phone] …a relaxed
environment where fun and productivity

302
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,920
are at the top of the agenda.

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
-[Dylan] Hi, Hannah.
-Hi.

304
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,600
Just checking that
you're happy with everything.

305
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,080
Mwah! Absolutely.

306
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh, great.

307
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,120
If you decide to use my image
in the video,

308
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,600
you'll need a release form.

309
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
It's an extra thousand.

310
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
[splutters] We've--

311
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
we've already paid you $500, Dylan.

312
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,560
That's more like a call-out fee.

313
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
[forced laugh] Um…

314
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,600
[Hannah] Dylan, I've been very charitable,

315
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,440
and I don't want to
have to call your mother.

316
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Um, and so what happened next, Dylan?

317
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,560
Miss Howard raised her voice.

318
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,760
Oh, it was just above
speaking level. That's…

319
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,680
Well, it-- it wasn't.

320
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,200
I could hear it in here all the way
on the other side of the office.

321
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I project.

322
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,560
Well, it was a raised voice.

323
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,640
She entered my personal space

324
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,080
and started to threaten me.

325
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,760
That is just a lie. That's what that is.

326
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,040
It's just, like, a lie.

327
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,280
[tsks]

328
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,800
How would you like to proceed, Dylan?

329
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,520
I guess you could pixelate my face.

330
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,000
It's not so much the job
that's challenging.

331
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
It's the people.

332
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,200
The people…

333
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,320
being Hannah.

334
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,920
She's the people.

335
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,080
-It's just Hannah.
-[phone ringing]

336
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,200
And there's Hannah.

337
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,120
Great.

338
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,840
You only usually have one.

339
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,120
-There's too many for any--
-Is that bad?

340
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,040
"Is that bad?"

341
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,600
Cheers. What a rollercoaster of a day.

342
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Is it?

343
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,680
Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,960
Started off thinking
I was gonna meet the love of my life

345
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,440
-at a flamenco class…
-Mm.

346
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,480
…only to discover my ancestors
are all cabbage farmers.

347
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,520
[laughs] Oh…

348
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
-From Wales.
-Crazy.

349
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,520
Probably can't even dance.

350
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,040
[Nick laughs sympathetically]

351
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,400
So obviously…

352
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,360
That's… yeah.

353
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,560
I mean…

354
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,200
Hey, do you know,
I should probably get back to my desk.

355
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,760
-But you can come tell me later.
-Yeah.

356
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,080
-Yeah, okay.
-[Nick] Yeah.

357
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,720
Geez, what a rollercoaster of a day.

358
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,080
Yeah.

359
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,480
Okay. That sounds good.

360
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,360
-Sorry I'm just on the phone, sorry.
-[Lloyd] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,400
Yeah, I will, I will do that. Yeah.

362
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,240
[softly] Oh, sorry,
could you close the door?

363
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

364
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,240
[Hannah] Yeah. I love this one.

365
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,360
Yeah, but you, um…

366
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,600
You stumble over your line in this take.

367
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,280
Yeah, but I look hotter.

368
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,120
-Mm?
-Yeah…

369
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,120
Can you check with Greta
and see how the testimonial's going?

370
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,640
Actually, I wrote your testimonial.

371
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,840
What?

372
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,640
Well, when I delegated to her
the coffee problem,

373
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,040
she delegated to me
the testimonial problem.

374
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,240
Oh no.

375
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,400
No, no. It's good.

376
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,440
It's really good.

377
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,440
Hannah Howard is an exceptional leader,

378
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,240
made stronger by the amazing team
she has gathered around herself.

379
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,840
In particular,

380
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,320
the backbone of her operation,
Lizzie Moyle.

381
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,400
None of that's not true.

382
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,080
[Hannah in video] Good news.

383
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,840
-Good news. Yeah.
-Good news.

384
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,400
-It's good, isn't it? Ah…
-[computer notification chimes]

385
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,720
[Hannah] Ooh, it's Alisha!

386
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,960
[Hannah grunts]

387
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
Hello, Alisha!

388
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,080
Coming to you live from an ant farm.

389
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,320
Oh, hey, Hannah. I'm, um…

390
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm just calling to check how
the application's going.

391
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,520
Oh, amazingly. I bet--

392
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
You should see this video,
honestly. I'll do--

393
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,040
I'll share my screen. That thing.

394
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,560
You can't share the screen.
It's on my computer.

395
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,720
[Hannah] Oh. Ah…

396
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
Well, uh, yeah, hold it up.

397
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,280
He's gonna show you.

398
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,640
[Hannah on video]
Here at Flinley Craddick,

399
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,880
I like to create a relaxed environment

400
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,520
where fun and productivity

401
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
are at the top of the agenda.

402
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,200
What… what's… what's…

403
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,360
What's this?

404
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,800
Um, it's, that's the video for my app.

405
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,000
Your application?

406
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,920
[in French accent] Oui, ma application.

407
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,920
Um, Hannah, I think you might have
got the wrong end of the stick.

408
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
I was suggesting that we nominate Greta.

409
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,400
[silence]

410
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,600
Um…

411
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,840
No, no, your…

412
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,520
your email--

413
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,320
I've printed it up. [forced laugh]

414
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,560
And it says, "This came across my desk."

415
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,560
"You should consider. Greta?"

416
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,280
"Will need to write a testimonial."

417
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,480
[Alisha] You should consider Greta
for the award

418
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
and you will need to write
a testimonial for her.

419
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,320
Well, that… that's not what that means.

420
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,720
[Alisha] Hope you haven't spent
too much time on this, Hannah.

421
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,680
Nope.

422
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,400
No. [forced laugh]

423
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,440
Nah. God, like, what? Five minutes?

424
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,440
Max?

425
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,400
-Max.
-Great.

426
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,800
Well, I need it on my desk by 5:00 p.m.

427
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,720
Okay.

428
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,560
[Alisha] I have to go.
-Sure.

429
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,200
Yeah, no, I've got to go too.

430
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,880
-Just, um…
-I've got a busy day, all right?

431
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,320
Yeah I'm--

432
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,960
Yeah, no, I've got--

433
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm swamped!

434
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,920
So, can I, um, stop?

435
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,440
Yeah. Thank you.

436
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,680
[telephone ringing]

437
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,680
[Tina] Flinley Craddick, Tina speaking.

438
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,160
Um… hey, everyone.

439
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,960
Just a bit of an update on
the old awards hoo-ha.

440
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,119
I have decided to step aside

441
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,160
and, um, nominate Greta.

442
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,880
-Whoo! Yeah!
-[scattered clapping]

443
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,000
Uh, why?

444
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,319
[Hannah] Um…

445
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,000
'Cause I've had
considerable success in my career,

446
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,160
and there's…

447
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,599
there's no more room
in the trophy cabinet.

448
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
So, um, yeah.

449
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,119
Congratulations, Greta,

450
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,839
and if anyone needs me,
I'll be in the office

451
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,000
writing her a glowing testimonial.

452
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,160
I don't want to be Western Sydney
Businesswoman of the Year.

453
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
I don't want to be
the businesswoman of any year.

454
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,480
I don't want to be a businesswoman.

455
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,680
-[Nick sings] Business Woman of the Year.
-Stop it.

456
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,880
[Dylan] Hey, everyone.

457
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
Jonny's doing iced coffees
and Portuguese tarts.

458
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
-[indistinct eager chatter]
-Coffee?

459
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,080
-Did he say coffee?
-[Lloyd] Yeah, yeah.

460
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,400
[eager chatter]

461
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,320
I'm not applying.

462
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,280
Why not? You could be
the next Hannah Howard.

463
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,200
And that's why I'm not applying.

464
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,480
You'd actually be a pretty good boss.

465
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,320
-"Pretty good"?
-Mm.

466
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,840
Passable.

467
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
You'd be a great boss.

468
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,240
-I know.
-[slurps]

469
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,000
[Lizzie] So next Tuesday
at 11:30 a.m.,

470
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,400
you have a supplier meeting
to negotiate contracts.

471
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
-Move it.
-Okay.

472
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,880
Knock-knock. G'day.

473
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,120
That's for you, Hannah.

474
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,240
[Hannah clears throat]

475
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,360
$890? What's this?

476
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Oh, that's the invoice for today.

477
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,840
Who's… covering this?

478
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,560
You are, apparently.

479
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,720
Is that what you told Greta?

480
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,320
You said "whatever the cost".

481
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,280
I--

482
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
[softly] Well, I didn't mean literally.

483
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,080
Well, how did you mean it not literally?

484
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,600
Metaphorically.

485
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm gonna let you handle this one.
Hey, good on you, Hannah.

486
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,240
[Stevie] See you later.

487
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,600
[Hannah] $890?!

488
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,800
You need to return that money to Hannah
now that there's no video.

489
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,000
Doesn't work like that.

490
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Your mum will be very disappointed
when she finds out that you exploited her.

491
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,760
Don't hate the player.

492
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,600
Hate the game.

493
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,200
What does that even mean?

494
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Far out.

495
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,320
That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.

496
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,120
You still need to sign out.

497
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,760
[lift dings]

498
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,520
[Lloyd] $890.

499
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,040
What did you want me to do with this?

500
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,280
Be the hero your ancestors weren't.

501
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,400
By paying for coffee?

502
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
It's bold.

503
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,880
It's brave.

504
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,320
You'd be a hero.

505
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,960
You'd be my hero.

506
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,120
I'll even hang a framed photo
of the occasion

507
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,560
in my office on the wall.

508
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,680
-Okay.
-[Hannah] Yeah.

509
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,720
-Great.
-[Hannah] Yeah?

510
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,760
[Lloyd] I'll probably have to
pay in instalments.

511
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,720
Not a problem.

512
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,080
Just have to move some money
around or something.

513
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,240
Yeah…

514
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,720
Okay. Hey, thanks.

515
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,920
[Hannah] Who's my hero?

516
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,800
-Me.
-You are.

517
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,920
Okay.

518
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,840
[theme music playing]
