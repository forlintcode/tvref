00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:03,424
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from
the hospital today.

2
00:00:03,565 --> 00:00:05,961
- Can you sign his card?
- Oh, great.

3
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:08,497
"Glad they didn't mix up
your tonsillectomy

4
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:11,617
with a moustachectomy."

5
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:12,885
Oh, that's not good.

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:15,087
Oh, because your jokes
are all hilarious.

7
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:16,639
It's nice.
It's funny.

8
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:18,040
It mentions his tonsillectomy

9
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:19,558
and makes a funny little joke
about his moustache.

10
00:00:19,593 --> 00:00:22,928
Stanley doesn't have
a moustache.

11
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,346
Yeah, he does.

12
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,731
Pam, hit the brakes.

13
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,750
Stanley does not have
a moustache.

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,520
I misspoke
I'm-- not sure...

15
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,138
I think he has one,
now that--

16
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,607
I think he has a moustache.

17
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:36,725
Okay. Phyllis sits
across from him every day.

18
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,260
Phyllis, does he have
a moustache or not?

19
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:41,080
Ooh, I don't know.
Now I think he doesn't.

20
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:42,615
Phyllis, what are you talking--

21
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,733
The whole card depends on this!

22
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:46,402
Okay. The man's worked here
for 25 years.

23
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:48,587
How can none of us
picture his face?

24
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:50,072
'Cause we come here
to do our jobs.

25
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:52,057
We don't stick our noses
in other people's business.

26
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:55,244
Okay. Which one of these
looks more right?

27
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:56,879
Neither of those
looks like any person

28
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,447
that has ever existed
or been dreamt of

29
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:00,299
in the history
of human insanity.

30
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,401
That said, the one on the left.

31
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:04,453
Guys, that's the elevator.

32
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,505
- What if it's him?
- Okay, quick.

33
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:09,275
Who says moustache?

34
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:10,476
Yep.

35
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,511
Who says no moustache?

36
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:20,819
Ah! Ha ha ha!

37
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:22,321
- Oh, man!
- Hey!

38
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,656
- He does have one.
- Yes!

39
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,693
Welcome back, Stanley.

40

41
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:39,505
"Good morning, Robert,"
says no one,

42
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:42,508
because our receptionist
is in Florida.

43
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:49,949
Pam!

44
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,667
Oh!

45
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:53,636
Is this a video conference
you're having with...

46
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,221
"Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz"?

47
00:01:56,273 --> 00:01:58,941
Um, no, I was just, um,
just having a cup of coffee,

48
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,225
kind of warming up for the day.

49
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:03,028
People, you should
come to work already warm.

50
00:02:03,063 --> 00:02:04,980
9:00 to 10:00 AM

51
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:08,350
is the most productive
potential that a human being--

52
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:09,485
Sorry, sorry, everyone,
I'm late!

53
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,704
But you are all here,

54
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:14,156
so no harm done at all
by my lateness.

55
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,241
Nellie, really, 9:50?

56
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:18,077
Oh, here's what happened.

57
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:20,746
7:46,
my alarm clock goes off.

58
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:22,331
I hear it.
Whack the snooze.

59
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:24,049
- Ah.
- Nine minutes.

60
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,051
Bzzz!
Off it goes again.

61
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:27,369
Whack!

62
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,555
Seven more times I did that.

63
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:31,757
Bzzz-- Whack.
Bzzz-- Whack!

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,426
By the time I got up,
it was ten minutes to go.

65
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:37,479
No willpower.
That is my curse!

66
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:38,931
I've never believed willpower

67
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,733
was very important in a woman.

68
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,184
Ah ha!

69
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:45,237
I don't think
you would have shown up to work

70
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,940
nearly an hour late
for no reason.

71
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,992
Oh, I assure you,
I would have done.

72
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:52,194
I did,
and I will keep doing it.

73
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:54,413
No, no, no, no.
There's something going on.

74
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:55,581
Some stress in your life.

75
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,616
Well, yes, uh...

76
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,570
There is the whole
moving to Scranton nonsense.

77
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:04,590
30 boxes arrived yesterday
from england,

78
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:05,958
and two trunks from Florida.

79
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:08,627
Then I have to move
into my apartment

80
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:12,064
in this dreadful,
God knows where it is

81
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,866
backwater suburb of a suburb,

82
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,351
and I mean, no offense,

83
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:18,420
but are there a lot of
Irish people living around here?

84
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:19,938
- Yes.
- Yes.

85
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,523
Ugh! I hate that!

86
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:22,574
No offense.

87
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,109
- None taken.
- Actually, Nellie,

88
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:26,612
this monologue you're delivering
is very offensive.

89
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,280
Oh! <i>Ay, caramba!</i>

90
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,599
The natives
are getting restless!

91
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:31,933
- Who's a native?
- Uh, excuse me.

92
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:34,653
The tone here
is getting quite hostile.

93
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:36,739
I would appreciate it
if you would keep that stuff

94
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,407
on the basketball court.

95
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,492
- Oh...
- Okay. Okay.

96
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:42,795
If you'd let me finish--

97
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,997
or the squash court,

98
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:47,516
or the supreme court.

99
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,134
- Hmm?
- Nellie.

100
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,636
Yes, Robert!

101
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,640
You're clearly
under a lot of... Stress

102
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:57,793
with the moving
and the work situation

103
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,928
- you've found yourself in.
- Yes.

104
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,647
Let's help her out, shall we?

105
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:04,600
Go above and beyond today

106
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:09,655
to show her some of that warm
Scranton hospitality.

107
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,490
Jim, Dwight.

108
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,325
Take the day.
Help Nellie

109
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,328
move those boxes
into her new place.

110
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:17,663
Why Jim?

111
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:20,416
The rest of you,
let's throw a party

112
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,700
at the end of the day

113
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:24,653
to welcome the newest member
of our little community.

114
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,288
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,006
We're throwing a party
for someone

116
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,475
because they're being horrible?

117
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,093
I'm sorry.
We're taking work time

118
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:32,461
to move someone's
personal belongings

119
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:33,645
into their new apartment.

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,631
I'm still not sure why
this woman is even here.

121
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,399
Why is she here?

122
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:40,686
♪ two crazy kids
on the journey of life ♪

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,223
♪ going to Pennsylvania ♪

124
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,842
On the road
with my new girlfriend.

125
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,061
But first, a small pit stop

126
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,063
to break up with
my current girlfriend

127
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:54,683
who is at her parents' cabin
in Southern Pennsylvania.

128
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,151
Oh. That must be nice.

129
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:58,320
Mm-hmm.
It's a beautiful place.

130
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:00,572
Great place
to let her down easy.

131
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:03,575
Oh, no, no, I mean that
must be nice to have parents.

132
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:06,011
Oh.
Hmm.

133
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:08,697
♪ time to have a little kiss ♪

134
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,532
- No.
- Mm. Sorry.

135
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,718
Right. No kisses
till the breakup is official.

136
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:14,136
- Yes.
- I believe in that.

137
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,904
- Yes. So do I.
- I think that's important.

138
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,890
That is important.
Bummer... But important.

139
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,391
- Important.
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:22,060
I can't believe he's making us
throw a party for her.

141
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,211
- I know, right?
- She's always late.

142
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,563
She's always rude.

143
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:27,683
It kinda makes me want
to throw a really bad party.

144
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,251
- Yeah.
- On purpose.

145
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,086
Phyllis!

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,888
We should do it

147
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,406
right here in the break room.

148
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:37,860
Order carrot cake.

149
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:42,614
And Jessica, just so you know,

150
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:44,199
this is way more
about my love for Erin

151
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,951
than anything wrong with you.

152
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:48,420
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but...

153
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:50,072
You did this
in the best way possible,

154
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:52,958
and I knew you as a lover...

155
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,260
And I'll remember you
as a gentleman.

156
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:58,063
Okay. That was one minute
and ten seconds.

157
00:05:58,097 --> 00:06:00,883
Consider it nailed.

158
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,050
I think we should try it again.

159
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,603
This time,
worst-case scenario.

160
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:06,104
Okay, here we go.
Jessica,

161
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,423
I'm really sorry.
I just need you to know--

162
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:09,892
- What?

163
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:11,693
I just need you to know--

164
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:14,596
What is it?
I didn't sleep well last night.

165
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,601
Ugh!

166
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:21,603
- Ow.
- Nellie, that reminds me.

167
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,905
Do you want this chair
in the bedroom?

168
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,239
'Cause to be honest,
I don't think

169
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:25,457
it's gonna
fit through the door.

170
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,959
Don't listen to Jim.

171
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:28,410
Have you ever seen him
play Tetris?

172
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,629
"Oh, I think I'll just use
this line horizontally.

173
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:33,165
Oh, I had no idea what a gift
this line is."

174
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,951
- The one time--
- I will get the chair in.

175
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:38,086
Watch the great Schrutini
work his magic.

176
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,888
Oh, no.
Really? Magic?

177
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:41,757
No, no, no.
Let's not go there.

178
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,344
No, nothing is more repellant
than magicians.

179
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,513
Bunch of grown men
waving wands,

180
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:50,682
pulling bunnies
out of body crevices.

181
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,285
Magicians are repulsive.
Next topic.

182
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,687
Excuse me, one second.

183
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:58,023
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?

184
00:06:58,074 --> 00:07:00,659
Ah, nothing, just hauling
some cube with Dwight.

185
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,027
Haulin' cube!

186
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:03,412
That's moving boxes.

187
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:06,314
We just came up with the term
to make it sound cooler.

188
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,983
So we're planning
this party for Nellie,

189
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:10,202
and we're gonna make it
really bad.

190
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:11,720
Sounds like every other party.

191
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:14,039
No. We're gonna make it
like a prank.

192
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:16,975
Like order bad food, give her
this passive-aggressive card.

193
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,927
Oh! Hire a magician.

194
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:20,679
- What?
- Trust me.

195
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:23,164
Okay.

196
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:29,972
Oh.

197
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:31,807
Wow. There's a lot
of cars here.

198
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:33,692
This is just weird.

199
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:36,645
Andy!

200
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,981
Hey, what are you doing here?

201
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:40,565
Hey, Lauren.
Look at you.

202
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,534
Well, I know.
Look at me.

203
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:44,519
I was just on my way back
from this business trip,

204
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:46,071
thought I'd stop
and say hi to Jessica.

205
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:47,406
Aww!

206
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:49,825
Why is Erin with me?
That's a great question.

207
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,159
She is my coworker,

208
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:54,713
and she needed a ride
because she totaled her car.

209
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:56,331
Oh.
God.

210
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:57,716
So I'm Erin.
Hi.

211
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,501
- Yep. This is Erin.
- Nice to meet you.

212
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:04,039
Well, Jess went out for a run,

213
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:05,874
but she'll be back soon.

214
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,225
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, ladies.

215
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,861
Andy's here.

216
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:13,048
Okay, Andy,
that is a bachelorette party,

217
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:15,267
this is Jessica's friends,

218
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:17,069
an they've been drinking
during the daytime.

219
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:19,104
Should we go?

220
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,273
You know, we had such a quick
window to make this work,

221
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:23,108
I think we should
probably just--

222
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,393
Oh, Jess!

223
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:26,945
Look who stopped by
after his business trip.

224
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:29,915
Andy!
Hey!

225
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,700
I wonder if king-sized
sheets

226
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:34,136
are called presidential-sized
in england.

227
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,888
I really should have
a tweeter account.

228
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:39,291
Yes, you should.

229
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,893
Ooh!

230
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:45,047
"Nellie, don't open, stupid.
Love, Nellie."

231
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,383
- I have to see these shoes.
- I doubt that they're sh--

232
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:52,437
Whoa.

233
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:55,107
Who's this guy?

234
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:57,092
Here's the two of them
taking a hike.

235
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,061
I'm guessing
he's some kind of friend.

236
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,896
Boyfriend.

237
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,597
Here's the two of them
kissing at a beach

238
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:05,484
and kissing
at the Eiffel Tower.

239
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,819
I'm guessing he's some kind
of close romantic friend.

240
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,270
Like a boyfriend?

241
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:12,074
- You read my mind.
- Yeah.

242
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:15,410
Whoa. Here's one with
his face whited out.

243
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:17,496
Hmm. Maybe someone
threw a pie in his face.

244
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,631
New theory-- He's a hated
Italian politician.

245
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:21,416
Better theory--
This is her ex-boyfriend,

246
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,668
and they went through
some kind of painful breakup.

247
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,237
- Oh, Nellie.
- Oh.

248
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,090
I'm so sorry.
We were just...

249
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:30,058
I see you've discovered
Benjamin.

250
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:33,562
That's what I call my box
full of photos of Henry.

251
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:34,528
- Why not call...
- Shh!

252
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,398
God. We owned a flat together.

253
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,903
Then one morning,
just like that, he was gone.

254
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,556
He ran off with the waitress
at our favorite restaurant.

255
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,191
That's awful.

256
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,160
What kind of restaurant?

257
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,378
Dwight.

258
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:52,746
I couldn't afford
the flat myself.

259
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:54,932
So I sold it at a loss.

260
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:57,501
Ah, but what's ten years
of bliss down the drain

261
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,503
compared with the thrill
of starting over

262
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:01,505
with nothing and no one?

263
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,806
I'm so sorry.

264
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,541
These must be
very painful memories.

265
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,176
If it would help you to forget,

266
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,230
I could hit you in the brain
stem with this candle stick.

267
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:11,882
Thank you.

268
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,350
No.

269
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:16,203
Jim, Dwight, please...

270
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,273
Don't tell anyone about this.

271
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:21,625
No, no.
Of course.

272
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,328
Just one quick question.

273
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:27,030
Was this, um, Halloween or...

274
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:28,949
No.

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,518
That's the most embarrassing
thing of all of this.

276
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:33,069
What kind of fool
gets her heart broken

277
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,238
by a bloody stage magician?

278
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:38,792
Hey, you know what, Pam?

279
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,761
I was thinking maybe
we should change course here.

280
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:41,879
Let's give up
on all this mean stuff.

281
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:44,031
What? No!
No, I just had

282
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,550
this brilliant idea--
Everyone loved it.

283
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,519
You don't have a copyright
on pranks.

284
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:50,571
I might be better
at this than you.

285
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,756
- No, that's not what I--
- Jim, could you give us a hand?

286
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:53,974
Absolutely.
Yeah.

287
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,609
Call it off, Pam.
Call it off, okay?

288
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:57,411
It's way more complicated
than you think.

289
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:59,262
Cancel the magician.
Trust me.

290
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,864
Oh. O-okay.

291
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,317
Okay, I will.

292
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:09,156
- Pam, we have a great idea.
- Listen to this.

293
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:10,774
We're gonna have the
fluorescent lights flickering.

294
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,409
It's gonna make everyone sick.

295
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,745
- Or what if...
- Okay.

296
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,330
We discuss...

297
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:19,416
The idea of doing the party

298
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,801
totally normal?

299
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:22,970
Like... Not mean.

300
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:25,272
Just a regular party.

301
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:27,257
Not mean.

302
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,342
I knew she'd crack!

303
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:30,344
I wanted to leave you out,
you know.

304
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:31,562
We're in far too deep.

305
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:33,129
We can't change course
at this point.

306
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:34,982
What are you talking about?
Of course we can.

307
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:36,683
What I mean to say is
we don't want to.

308
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:38,268
Toots, we're not stopping
this train,

309
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:40,537
so get off the tracks.

310
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:41,989
Suck it!

311
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:45,826
- Andy--
- It'll be fine.

312
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,194
Just act natural.

313
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:48,862
Do you want a gummy penis?

314
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:51,298
No, I'll just have
some gummy bears.

315
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:53,867
- These are delicious.
- But... they're penises.

316
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:56,036
And we come to Matthew,

317
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,871
the guy who was with
his old girlfriend

318
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:00,007
basically the whole time
we were together.

319
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,157
- Oh!
- Eew!

320
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,710
Eew! Aw!
That seems gross...

321
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:05,796
At first blush, right?

322
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,316
But relationships are always
more complicated than you think.

323
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,470
I mean, we don't know Matthew's
history with this other woman.

324
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:16,723
Maybe she saved his life.
I don't know.

325
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:18,675
I just-- I don't think
we should rush to judgment

326
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:20,544
about Matthew.
Maybe we don't pop that one.

327
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:22,145
- No, pop Matthew.
- Pop it!

328
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,365
Pop it!

329
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,817
- Hey.
- Hey.

330
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,986
Sorry.
It's kind of a madhouse.

331
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,871
- Aah!
- Oh!

332
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:32,372
Ha ha ha! Megan!

333
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,491
You are one of the good ones,
nard dog.

334
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:36,326
- Aw...
- No, really.

335
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,527
Where's my Andy?

336
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:39,863
- I dunno.
- Oh, he's out there.

337
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,865
Are you gonna sing for us?

338
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:43,667
Well, you guys are doing
a pretty good job

339
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,385
with the scary yelling, so...

340
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,054
That's not like you.
That's not like you.

341
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:49,539
Come on, sing!
Sing!

342
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:52,593
♪ beyond Bonnie Banks ♪

343
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:55,762
♪ and beyond Bonnie Brae's ♪

344
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,564
Okay, they're almost here.

345
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,850
What?
Come on!

346
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:03,186
If you guys are gonna be mean,
can you at least be subtle?

347
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,857
Oh, in the warehouse
we use code names

348
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:08,492
for people
we want to talk about.

349
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:11,728
Andy was Jelly Roll.
Mike was Dennis The Menace.

350
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:13,229
Ryan was douche bag.

351
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:15,916
Hey, that's not a code name.
That's just an insult.

352
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,284
Plus, everyone would know
who you meant.

353
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:19,286
- Yeah.
- No. That's a great idea.

354
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,121
Yes, let's have a code name.
How 'bout mondays?

355
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:24,240
I hate mondays?
Mondays are the worst?

356
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,626
Nobody's named Monday.

357
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,594
Hey, how 'bout we go with Pam?

358
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:28,912
Simple, easy to remember.

359
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,798
'Cause there's someone
already here named Pam.

360
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,134
Hey!

361
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:35,736
Welcome to your party.

362
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,070
Everybody get comfy now.

363
00:13:37,105 --> 00:13:39,940
This first song's
over a half hour long.

364
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:46,897
Best gig ever.

365
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,099
They asked me
to play only originals.

366
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,901
I said, "Have you heard
my originals?

367
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:53,253
They're terrible."
They said, "Even better."

368
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,055
I said, "I get it.

369
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,808
It's an ironic party
for Nellie."

370
00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:59,326
Maybe we should just go.

371
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:01,995
No. I gotta do this.

372
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:03,914
Hey, Jessica,
can I talk to you?

373
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:05,966
Uh, yeah, sure.
What's up?

374
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,634
Maybe we could talk in private.

375
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:10,337
Uh... yeah.
What is it?

376
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,305
Well, first let me just say

377
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,909
that I hope when I'm done
with the sort of ugly bits

378
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,811
that we can stay friends.

379
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,446
You're breaking up with me?

380
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,598
Uh... No.

381
00:14:21,632 --> 00:14:22,816
No.

382
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,519
You always do this.
You twist my words around.

383
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,522
Part of me thinks we should
just end this right now.

384
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,857
Oh, my God.

385
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:32,192
Are you leaving me for Erin?

386
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:35,278
You said she wasn't
relationship material,

387
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:37,480
and she wasn't as good as me,
but it's her, isn't it?

388
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:38,949
Whoa!

389
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:39,983
That-- No.

390
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:40,984
Okay.

391
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:42,619
You want honesty?

392
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:45,338
Super-honesty time.

393
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:46,707
I'm gay.

394
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:47,958
What?

395
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:51,494
I am gay, and I prefer men.

396
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,797
- I knew it!
- You did not, Kenny!

397
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:55,716
You invited me to go
shopping with you.

398
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,834
I like hanging out with you.

399
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,803
You're a cool guy.

400
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:02,222
Which proves my point.
That I'm gay.

401
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:04,641
Andy, you're not gay.

402
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:07,060
I mean, we were... together.

403
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:09,696
And you seemed
pretty excitable.

404
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:11,982
Well, I was faking it.

405
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,784
I had to fake it every time.

406
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:15,852
I had to imagine
that I was in a steam room

407
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,154
with John Stamos.

408
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:21,491
I can't say
it doesn't make sense...

409
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:22,876
- Well...
- Look, it's--

410
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,861
I mean, I was good
at hiding it, but--

411
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,030
It's fine, Andy.

412
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:29,716
I didn't think we were
gonna get married or anything.

413
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,885
I just...

414
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,253
I'm just upset for now.

415
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,888
Understandable.

416
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,057
And I'm really sorry.

417
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,892
I really am.

418
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:44,848
So... we should probably...

419
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:47,317
go.

420
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:55,640
This humble but sincere effort

421
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:58,092
is all for our
valued new colleague.

422
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,744
Excellent.

423
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:00,979
To Nellie Bertram.

424
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,981
You are a most welcome
and friendly presence

425
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:04,149
at our company.

426
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,618
- Cheers.
- Why, thank you.

427
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:08,953
Pam, on the other hand,

428
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:12,323
is a most unwelcome,
entitled, unfriendly presence

429
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,792
in our company.

430
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:16,294
Cheers.

431
00:16:16,328 --> 00:16:18,797
Nellie is terrific,

432
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,582
but to be honest,

433
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:23,001
every day I imagine
how happy I'd be

434
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,269
if Pam died.

435
00:16:26,422 --> 00:16:28,173
Oh. Well.

436
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:30,892
I feel that as someone
who knows Pam

437
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,927
only a little bit...

438
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:35,129
Enough.
A good amount.

439
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:37,098
Not the most, though.

440
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:38,983
I would say
that she is misunderstood

441
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:41,903
and that maybe there's
some stuff in her past

442
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:43,405
that you guys don't know about

443
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:44,773
that's a little messed up,

444
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:47,192
and probably makes her
such a torture to work with.

445
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,944
We hate Pam.
We hate Pam.

446
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:52,947
We hate Pam!
We hate Pam!

447
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:55,200
- We hate pa--
- So we've established...

448
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,619
- No. No.
- That you guys hate Pam.

449
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:01,790
Do you ever wish she would
just... Disappear?

450
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:02,957
Oh!

451
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:08,480
That was a really rough scene.

452
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:11,049
- Right? Rough scene.
- Yeah.

453
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,002
Oh... At least
we can kiss now.

454
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,105
Oh, yeah.

455
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:23,478
You know, that stuff
that I said about you to her...

456
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:25,980
I did-- That's just--
I had to say it.

457
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:28,366
You know, I was dating her
at the time.

458
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,584
Yeah.

459
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:31,669
Yes, of course.

460
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:35,523
- Ah... I feel really tired.
- Yeah.

461
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,425
Probably from seeing
that turkey.

462
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,911
- Oh, yeah.
- When we drove by the farm.

463
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:42,697
Ohh.
Always does it.

464
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:51,339
Are you Nellie?
Oh, I think you're my volunteer.

465
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:52,841
Come on over here, huh?

466
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,861
Oh, I'll do it.
I will volunteer.

467
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:58,513
- No, Nell-- She--
- I'll do it.

468
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:01,399
Oh! Big guy, huh?
How's the air up there?

469
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:04,552
Watch out for... birds.

470
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:10,224
All right, let's, uh--
Let's do some card magic.

471
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:12,243
Now, what I want you
to do is...

472
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:15,079
I want you to pick a card
just by looking at it.

473
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:18,082
Do not say what it is.

474
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,553
It's the 4 of hearts.

475
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:23,588
Oh, no, you--

476
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:26,925
Looks like we got a guy
from another country here, huh?

477
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,761
No hablo el cardo, señor?

478
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:31,095
Hmm? Ha.

479
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,547
All right, the card is picked.

480
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:35,800
Now, sir, will you please
shuffle the deck?

481
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,742
You didn't just do that
on... Purpose, did ya?

482
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:47,228
Why is Jim treating
the magician poorly?

483
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:48,863
Little known fact
about me--

484
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:52,700
Before I was a magician,
I used to work...

485
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,268
- at a rope factory.
- Not true.

486
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:55,987
'Cause that's not a real place.

487
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,123
But I never could seem
to figure out those knots.

488
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:00,325
That's not a real knot.

489
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:01,876
When you pull on it,
it disappears.

490
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:03,411
What the hell?

491
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:04,913
All right, where's Phyllis?

492
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:07,165
Who's Phyllis?

493
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,583
Look!

494
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:10,952
This is really uncool, okay?

495
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,837
I put on
a clean show here--

496
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,255
- Okay, scram, wizard.
- What?

497
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,840
- You heard me!
- Ho oh!

498
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:17,592
Well, Nellie, I'm sorry.

499
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:20,094
If I'd known Jim and Pam

500
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,280
would use this party
as an excuse

501
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:23,781
to abuse a magician--

502
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:25,984
Well, I thought
it was quite fun.

503
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:28,436
In fact, I think
they're brilliant employees

504
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,654
in their own way.

505
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:32,190
Don't you see what I see?

506
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:33,775
Interesting.
Yes.

507
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,860
No, yes, I see that.

508
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:38,145
Great work, team.

509
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:39,998
Great party.

510
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:42,417
You think this is
a great party?

511
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:45,353
This cake has vegetables in it.

512
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:47,422
Like a salad bar, Robert.

513
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:50,174
How do I get this taste
out of my mouth?

514
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,213
What?
Why are we--

515
00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:57,665
- I just gotta do one thing.

516
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:05,006
Oh. Hello.

517
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:06,808
Hey, everybody,
look who's here.

518
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:08,059
What are you doing here?

519
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,979
Hi.
Super-duper honesty time.

520
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:12,680
I'm not gay.

521
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:15,149
In fact, I'm so not gay
that I'm in love with a girl.

522
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:18,836
Her name is Erin Hannon,
and she's right there.

523
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:21,372
She's sweet, funny,
and beautiful,

524
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:24,842
and total relationship
material.

525
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:26,344
Why the hell
did you come back here?

526
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,329
- Go away.
- Get lost.

527
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:30,081
- Get out!
- Okay.

528
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:31,332
- You're done!
- Bye, guys.

529
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:32,717
Get out.
You ruined my party!

530
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,037
Who does that?
Are you kidding me?

531
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:37,505
Yeah, run away, Andy.

532
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,057
- Run away!
- You're disgusting!

533
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:42,376
I can't believe you're not gay!

534
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:45,596
- Yeah, get outta here.
- Don't come back.

535
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:49,434
Uh-oh.

536
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:50,601
- You don't even know how to drive!
- Bye, Andy!

537
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:51,967
- Loser!
- Nice car!

538
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,085
Have fun!

539
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:01,342
- Hey, Hank.
- Yes, ma'am.

540
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:05,440
I thought I was very specific about
not letting up a magician?

541
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:07,670
Yes, ma'am.
I got my eyes open.

542
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,890
Oh, turns out that he
actually made it up there.

543
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,862
What? That ain't right.

544
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:13,610
Yeah, he came and went.

545
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:16,065
Wait a minute!

546
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:18,737
You said he was a magician, right?

547
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:22,446
You don't think he could have used...
It couldn't have been...

548
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:27,072
Just let's go...

549
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,606
Night, night.
