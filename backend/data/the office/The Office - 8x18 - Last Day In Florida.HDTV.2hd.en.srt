1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:00,014
Okay. Bye.

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:05,245
Everyone stop
what you're doing.

3
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:07,097
I have terrible news.

4
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:08,765
Dwight is no longer with us.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,467
What?

6
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:13,887
He's gone, damn it!

7
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:16,306
He's been promoted
to VP of Sabre retail,

8
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:19,259
and he's staying
in Florida forever.

9
00:00:19,277 --> 00:00:20,844
So... He's alive.

10
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,979
Yeah.
That was him on the phone.

11
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:24,481
He sounds wonderful.

12
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:26,683
Well, the way you said it
made it sound like he was dead.

13
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:28,935
How could I have been
more clear?

14
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:31,404
He had a massive stroke
of good fortune

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,774
and he is now
in a better place.

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,308
If Dwight's not coming back,

17
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,827
does that mean we can open
his treasure?

18
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:37,977
Uh...

19
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:39,112
You guys, we've gone over this.

20
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:40,614
There is no treasure.

21
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:42,616
When the team left
for Tallahassee,

22
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,252
Dwight told everyone
not to touch his treasure.

23
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:47,153
Don't touch my treasure.

24
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,155
Okay? You understand?

25
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:50,640
Obviously, he wants us
to obsess about it.

26
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:54,294
There's nothing in there.

27
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:56,263
Which is obviously what
he would want us to think,

28
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:58,965
making it the perfect place
to hide a treasure!

29
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:00,133
Oh, God, I'm Wallace Shawn

30
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,935
<i>The Princess Bride!</i>

31
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,337
I think that Dwight
wanted us to realize

32
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,439
that this conversation
among friends

33
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:07,808
is the true treasure.

34
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:10,393
That's not Dwight.
No.

35
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,696
I am dying to know
what's in there.

36
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,197
Yeah, I know, Oscar.
We all are.

37
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:16,550
But nobody's gonna open it.
You'd have to be insane.

38
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,656
Hi, hello.

39
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,376
Now carefully open the box.

40
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,500
It's a photo of all of us.

41
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:35,886
Oh, that's so sweet.

42
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:40,590
A dart?
Are you kidding me?

43
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,475
Who would put a poison dart--

44
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,477
Well, I mean, I don't know
that it's poison.

45
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:49,399
I mean, I just have to imagine.
God, I'm glad he's okay though.

46
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:50,767
Kinda sounds like
he deserved it,

47
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:52,352
opening another man's
treasure and all.

48
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:53,720
Wow!

49
00:01:57,312 --> 00:02:01,553

50
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,177
Well, Mr. Ball,
it's been a pleasure.

51
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:21,097
Now give my regards to hell!
Dah!

52
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:25,418
All right!
Well swung, my VIP VP.

53
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,054
I am loving the chemistry
between you two.

54
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:29,556
I am so happy.

55
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,191
Dwight is gonna be working
alongside me.

56
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:35,729
We are a regular Archibald
and his man George.

57
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:37,647
I bet.
I'm excited.

58
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:39,950
Trick!
There's no such thing.

59
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:41,601
It's not even
a real English duo.

60
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,936
Ahh!

61
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,156
I just made you look
like the Goat of Dover.

62
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,741
And that doesn't exist either.

63
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:51,978
You think you're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

64
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:54,281
Boing!

65
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:57,200
Oh, that reminds me.
Little something from all of us.

66
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:58,802
Oh, my gosh.

67
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:01,254
Thank you, Jim.
That's so thoughtful.

68
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:06,960
Fore!

69
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:10,997
- Oh, yeah!
- He doesn't even care.

70
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:12,665
Don't even care!

71
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:14,267
This is the last time
I'll ever see Dwight.

72
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,019
It's a weird feeling.

73
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:18,388
It's, um...

74
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,523
What's the word?
It's not bittersweet.

75
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:22,943
It's, uh...

76
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:24,227
Sweet.

77
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:25,729
Yeah.

78
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,514
Hey, man.
Selling cookies for Jada.

79
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:30,317
Want the same as last year?

80
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:32,018
Would if I could
and I can, so I will.

81
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:34,120
Put me down for one box.

82
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:35,688
Don't care what it is,
dealer's choice.

83
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,991
I'll put you down
for shortbreads.

84
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,525
Damn it!

85
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,578
Knock, knock.

86
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,529
Hey, it's Sasha's first year
in the troupe,

87
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:44,881
so I'm selling cookies for her.

88
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:47,367
- Anyway, would you like some?
- No!

89
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:48,668
- No.
- What?

90
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,253
I've been selling here
for five years.

91
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:51,338
This is my spot.

92
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:54,007
You can't claim territories.

93
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,675
This is the only place
I interact with people.

94
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,477
Can't you sell at...

95
00:03:57,511 --> 00:04:01,681
Your church or barbershop?

96
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:03,683
Or... Chess club?

97
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:06,236
You know what?
It's your first time.

98
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,271
Let's split the office.

99
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:11,424
You can have sales,
the annex, creed.

100
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,393
And I don't know,
I'll just take, uh...

101
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:16,079
- Accounting.
- That's it?

102
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:19,616
Yeah, well, okay.
Thanks, Darryl.

103
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,901
Okay.
Great.

104
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,703
All I need is Kevin.

105
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:26,172
Dude buys more cookies
than everyone combined,

106
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,674
and then some.

107
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,209
When I first started
selling cookies,

108
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:30,877
he was a relatively thin man.

109
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:35,131
Not a thin man, mind you.
Relatively thin.

110
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:38,852
Hey, Lucy, I'm home!

111
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:40,020
Bobaloo!

112
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:42,689
- Oh, here, let me help.
- I got it.

113
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:44,974
It was so busy
at the store today.

114
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:46,893
Really good cheese samples.
I had, like, a hundred.

115
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,928
Irene hired me
as her live-in helper.

116
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:51,197
We met at the store launch.

117
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:53,800
I told her I was moving here
and I needed a place.

118
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,535
And it just sort of made sense.

119
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,287
I basically do
everything for her.

120
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:59,589
I run errands,
I do chores around the house,

121
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:00,990
I cook and clean.

122
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:04,044
Honestly, I don't know how
she survived without me.

123
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:07,247
When can I introduce you
to my grandson?

124
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,165
He's a wonderful swimmer.

125
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:12,302
Shallow end, deep end.
He does it all.

126
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:15,088
Well, today might be
kind of tough, Irene.

127
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:16,506
I have to talk
to my old boss Andy

128
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:19,042
and tell him I'm staying
in Florida.

129
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:26,299
Oh, what kind of tea is this?

130
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:30,320
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.

131
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:34,908
- Oh.
- Ah!

132
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,476
In england, they put the holes

133
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:39,028
a little bit to the right,
you see?

134
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,747
We'll just chalk it up
to cultural bias.

135
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,032
If I may...

136
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:46,152
Try holding the putter...

137
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,537
Here.

138
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,489
With your wrists here,

139
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,775
your thumbs here.

140
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,294
- Oh.
- That's right.

141
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:56,012
Your little finger.

142
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:59,665
Would you like to buy
some cookies?

143
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:02,519
- Cookies, eh?
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,304
♪ oh, the springtime thinks ♪

145
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:06,005

It's not
a scratch and sniff, Kev.

153
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:28,694
I know.

154
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:30,463
But sometimes you still
get a little something.

155
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,916
Hey, you tricked me.
You just wanted Kevin.

156
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:36,035
You're new to the game.
You learned a lesson today.

157
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,505
- See you next year, sport.
- No, no, no. It's not fair.

158
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:39,973
What if Kevin wants to buy
cookies from me?

159
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:41,808
- I do.
- See?

160
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:43,176
That doesn't mean anything.

161
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,261
Kevin, do you wanna
buy cookies from me?

162
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:47,347
Oh, I definitely do.

163
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,932
Huh.
Hit the road, Jack.

164
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,717
No, you hit the road, Jack.

165
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:55,104
Hey, guys, come on.
Don't fight over me.

166
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:56,189
Why don't we split the order?

167
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:57,524
It's only fair.

168
00:06:57,558 --> 00:06:59,892
No, wait, no.
I'm buying, I make the rules.

169
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,745
I actually do want you
to fight over me.

170
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,333
I wanna be wined and dined
and... sixty-nined.

171
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:09,502
Ugh.

172
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:12,338
Metaphorically
sixty-nined.

173
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:14,891
Ew! Perverts.

174
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,342
No offense, Oscar.

175
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:21,047
Hop in.
We have places to be.

176
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,765
No rest for the wicked.
Ha ha.

177
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,301
All right.
So...

178
00:07:25,352 --> 00:07:27,103
I guess this is it.

179
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:28,471
Well, Jim, I just wanna say

180
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,139
that we haven't always
gotten along.

181
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:31,391
And at times,
I've even hated your guts.

182
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:35,945
But...

183
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,532
Bye-bye.
I win.

184
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,234
- Good-bye, Dwight.

185
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:43,119
Robert! Race you
to the clubhouse.

186
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:48,491
Gentlemen's bet.
Whoo-hoo!

187
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:53,413
Well, he's Florida's
problem now.

188
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,298
Oh, let Dwight have his fun.

189
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:58,801
- Today will not be his day.
- What's that?

190
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,303
I'm gonna tank the Sabre store

191
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:01,638
at the presentation
to the board.

192
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:02,788
I thought you liked the store.

193
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:05,174
The store is lovely.

194
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:09,562
You created a wonderful space
to showcase our product line.

195
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:11,431
Great job!
Cheers.

196
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:14,234
Thank you.

197
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:17,654
But there's a reason
we sell our products online

198
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,989
and over the phone.

199
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:22,075
Have you ever used Sabre
electronics, Jim?

200
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,444
They're cheap.
They're unintuitive.

201
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,447
The Sabre store would work
if we adopted the carnival model

202
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:29,532
of leaving town
once everyone's wise to us.

203
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,951
Wow, when you put it that way,

204
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:33,786
I guess it does sound
pretty terrible.

205
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,322
I couldn't just kill
the project from the start.

206
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,207
Jo Bennett endorsed it.

207
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:41,044
Shame, though--
I did like Dwight.

208
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:43,129
Robert!
I'm gonna win!

209
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,932
Ha ha, I'm the gentleman!
Suck it!

210
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:50,436
Bravo, Dwight.
Very good.

211
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:51,788
Shame.

212
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:55,360
The math is simple, folks.

213
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:58,213
Deeper market penetration,
plus greater visibility,

214
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:04,186
- will raise Sabre...
- To the power of two.

215
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,871
How did that look?

216
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:07,189
I'm not just saying this.

217
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:09,708
That was the best thing
I've ever seen.

218
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,493
Told you.

219
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:14,046
When you guys do that whole
"power of two" shebang,

220
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,580
how about I pop up also?

221
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,116
I guess we'd have to say
"power of three."

222
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:21,887
Hmm, actually, you know what?
Yeah! That actually works.

223
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,005
You'd spin-off right,
I'd spin off--

224
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:24,789
You know what?
That is a great idea.

225
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:26,258
Cathy, write that down
and print it out.

226
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,060
It's gonna make some really
good toilet paper.

227
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,645
All right.
There he is.

228
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,346
What are you doing here?
I thought I got rid of you.

229
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:33,148
Can I just talk to you
for one quick second?

230
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:36,018
What, your stylist ran out
of messy spray?

231
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:39,104
Um, actually
it's for your own good.

232
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:40,138
I think we should--

233
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,189
You wanna do something
for my own good?

234
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,307
Turn around,
walk out that door,

235
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,692
do not stop till you get
to Scranton,

236
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:45,444
find my cell phone charger,
mail it back to me,

237
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:46,811
and then go to hell!

238
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,449
Nice!

239
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,417
Hey, Halpert,
anyone ever tell you

240
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:54,202
you look like Wooly Willie?

241
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,653
Silence.

242
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:57,806
I'm just trying--

243
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,141
I know what you're
trying to do.

244
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:01,893
I don't want it.

245
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:06,398
But your face does look like
the guy from "Operation."

246
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:07,766
It's the same guy.

247
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,518
- That's the joke I made.
- That's not--

248
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:10,519
- Different guy.
- You know what?

249
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,154
I just think
you should know--

250
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:14,823
That you look like
the world's tallest hobbit.

251
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:19,644
Well, I tried.
You saw it.

252
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:23,532
So it's on the record.
I have a plane to catch.

253
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,000
Can you help me?

254
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,703
I'm trying to make
a video chat with Andy.

255
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,621
Just open the program
and type in his username.

256
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:32,674
Can you just do it?

257
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:37,980
Here, type in your password.

258
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:40,899
Erin123.

259
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,785
That's a terrible password.

260
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:45,237
And you don't "make a video
chat"-- You "video chat."

261
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:47,623
All right!

262
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:52,561
Hello!

263
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:53,912
That's so weird.

264
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,114
There's something wrong
with my laptop.

265
00:10:56,132 --> 00:11:00,285
Oh! I fixed it.

266
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:06,225
Oh! Now mine's broken.
Hang on.

267
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,727
Oh, there we go.

268
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:10,562
Aghh!

269
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,481
He said "I did like Dwight"?

270
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:13,932
He's gonna fire him.

271
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,067
No, no, I think it was more
like, you know,

272
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:16,268
"I liked him,
but I don't any more,

273
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,469
'cause he did a bad job.

274
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:18,904
So I'm definitely
gonna yell at him."

275
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:20,305
Robert doesn't talk like that.

276
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:22,074
You have to stop Dwight
from doing this.

277
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:23,975
I tried.
He will not listen.

278
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:25,644
Did you actually
try your hardest?

279
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:26,978
Yes.

280
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,448
My pretty hardest.

281
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:31,149
Look, you haven't dealt with him
in a while, all right?

282
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,751
He's like Super Dwight.

283
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:36,205
It's like he's been bitten
by a radioactive Dwight or som--

284
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:38,540
- Stanley, back me up.
- Don't talk to me.

285
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:40,459
Stanley's very upset
that we're leaving Florida.

286
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,094
But he would back me up.

287
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:43,512
If Dwight's about to get fired,

288
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,163
you have to tell him.

289
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:47,349
Just get the words out,
that's all you can do.

290
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,935
Okay.
All right.

291
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:52,838
What's a skinny guy
like Toby know about cookies?

292
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:54,940
You can't trust him to
understand the wants and needs

293
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:56,308
of the thick man.

294
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:57,810
Maybe Toby from two years ago.

295
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:59,177
- Yeah.
- That's true.

296
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:01,563
If I have a question
about my cookies at midnight,

297
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:04,116
who am I gonna call?
Darryl.

298
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,735
Toby's probably in bed
with some model.

299
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:08,070
Thank you.

300
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:09,655
I'm not gonna comment
on my personal life.

301
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,790
Look, I need this.

302
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,826
Your daughter is
a pretty little girl.

303
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,861
Let her go door to door.

304
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,364
You think people are gonna
buy cookies from my...

305
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:22,534
Chubby daughter?

306
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,386
Baby, if you're watching this,
you're not chubby.

307
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:25,838
You're beautiful.

308
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:29,258
Daddy's just gotta sell
some cookies.

309
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,176
And we're also gonna
exercise more.

310
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:32,678
It's gonna be fun.

311
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:34,480
Oh, you know what you have
to do to decide?

312
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:35,848
You need to make them
do things for you.

313
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,349
And, like, buy you things.

314
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,884
Or have them sing that song

315
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:40,686
that the frog does
in <i>Looney Tunes.</i>

316
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,855
Make them kiss each other.

317
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,990
Make them kiss <i>me!</i>

318
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:47,860
Eww.

319
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:51,413
Yes! This is too tan.
This right here.

320
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:54,366
- No!
- This is a tan spot.

321
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,585
I don't buy it.
That is a freckle.

322
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,704
That is not a tan.

323
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,589
I'm gonna have to inspect it in
person when you get back here.

324
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:04,343
I want you looking
totally <i>puertoriquena</i>

325
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:05,794
when I see you.

326
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:08,297
Well, Andy,
I'm not coming back.

327
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:11,717
- What?
- I have a job here.

328
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,252
I work for an old lady.

329
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,087

No, no, no.

00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:22,454
♪ hello, my ragtime gal ♪

355
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,841
Showtime.

356
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,593
- Dwight.
- You again?

357
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:29,595
Gosh, I keep throwing you away,
you keep flying back.

358
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:30,996
You're like
an amish return-stick.

359
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:34,099
Okay, great, listen to me.
No, no, I know.

360
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,217
Will you just let me tell you
one thing, please?

361
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:36,218
Yes, you may tell me one thing.

362
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:37,269
Great!

363
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:38,270
Wait, do you wanna
borrow money?

364
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:39,271
Listen to me.

365
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:40,338
Robert is going to veto
the Sabre store.

366
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:41,557
Jim, come on.

367
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:42,724
Dwight, he's gonna kill
the store.

368
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,109
- Mm-hmm.
- And then I'm pretty sure

369
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:45,527
he's gonna fire you for it.

370
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:48,680
Wait, he's gonna kill
the store,

371
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:50,983
- and he's gonna fire me.
- Yes.

372
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,318
- That's two things.
- Dwight, please.

373
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,486
Nice try, Jim.

374
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,571
Your pranks have never worked
in the past,

375
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:56,955
and they're not gonna work
today.

376
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,290
Okay, first of all,
they've mostly worked.

377
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:00,042
You know what, you might
wanna get to the airport.

378
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,877
It's gonna take you a long time
to get through security

379
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:03,629
with all those beauty products.

380
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:06,582
- Bye!
- Dwight, come--

381
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:07,966
Nothing is gonna stop me.

382
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:09,701
That is the mark
of a great man--

383
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,470
Unstoppability.

384
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:14,222
Dunder Mifflin...
the farm, Mose.

385
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:16,008
All those things.

386
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:18,760
Vanish in my rearview mirror.

387
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:22,347
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date with destiny.

388
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,716
And from what I hear,
she's a-- Oh!

389
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,034
- Help!
- Shut up.

390
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,669
Oh, gross!
Don't lick my hand!

391
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:32,920
God, why is there
so much saliva?

392
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:33,955
All I had to do
was think about pie,

393
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:36,007
and my salivary glands
did the rest.

394
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,376
- Nah!
- What, what, what, what?

395
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:39,961
- Oh, my appendix.
- I'm sorry.

396
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,596
- My wound hasn't healed yet.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:43,631
- Oh, man.
- I'm so sorry, I forgot.

398
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:45,165
Are you all right?

399
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:48,135
Are you okay?

400
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,137
Dwight!

401
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:51,472
Where the hell is he?

402
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:52,673
I cannot do this without him.

403
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:56,777
I don't know.
He's not picking up.

404
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:59,280
Oh, look like shnoot's
a no-show.

405
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:02,817
Guess he wasn't Vice President
material after all.

406
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,319
But I am.
Put me in, babe.

407
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:07,371
I've got the info down
backwards, forwards,

408
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,123
and doggy-style.

409
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:11,375
I'm your man.

410
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:14,194
Right, let's begin then.

411
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:15,696
Ladies and gentlemen,

412
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:20,051
allow me to introduce the Vice
President of Sabre retail--

413
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:23,087
Mr. Todd Packer.

414
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:25,222
'Sup?

415
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,099
What are you doing?

416
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,435
Oh, I'm just dealing
with Erin's stuff

417
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:39,103
since apparently
she's not coming back

418
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:40,571
and she didn't bother
to tell anyone.

419
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:43,824
We knew.
Ryan told us.

420
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:45,109
Ryan, why didn't you tell me?

421
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,528
Thought you checked my Tumblr.

422
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:48,913
You never update it.

423
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,998
Well, I updated it.

424
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,918
Does anyone else
think this is weird?

425
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:56,070
And, like,
kind of uncool, actually?

426
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:57,371
To leave us
without a receptionist?

427
00:16:57,405 --> 00:17:00,074
We'll find another
receptionist.

428
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:04,078
I mean, that's easy.
We'll be fine.

429
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,664
Hup, hup, hup!

430
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:07,965
What are you doing?

431
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,333
- I was trying to go--
- Get up, get up.

432
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:11,218
Okay, okay!

433
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,503
All right?
I'm not gonna let you by.

434
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:13,921
Then you know what?

435
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,923
I'm gonna just have to run
right through you.

436
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:17,425
Okay.

437
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,893
What are you doing?

438
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:21,562
Are you really revving up?
You know that doesn't work.

439
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:23,898
Jackie chan!

440
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,234
Go.

441
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:29,103
Hi, this is Alex.

442
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:30,738
And this is Sam.

443
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:32,773
Kevin can't come
to the phone right now

444
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,425
because he's busy...
With us.

445
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,826
Perfect!

446
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:39,313
Now people will think
I'm doing hot girls all day.

447
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:41,148
I don't know, man, they might
think we're drag queens.

448
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,500
Yeah, I don't know why
you picked names

449
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,285
that are also guys' names.

450
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,420
Okay, now who do I ride
to the kitchen like a pony?

451
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:48,672
Don't make me be your pony,
Kevin.

452
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:50,591
- Forget it, man.
- What do you mean?

453
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,877
I'm out.
So is Toby.

454
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:54,345
This may be wrong,

455
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:56,547
but there's a limit
to what I would do for my child.

456
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:59,784
Yeah, I have my dignity too.

457
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:02,303
I refuse to be
another man's horsey.

458
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:06,557
No, guys! Stop!
You have to sell me cookies.

459
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:09,093
I'll do anything!

460
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:11,479
♪ Hello, my baby,
hello, my honey ♪

461
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,114
I'm even gonna kiss Meredith.

462
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:17,184
That's what--

463
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,870
That is--
Hmm.

464
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:24,375
That's... so good.

465
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:25,692
What are you doing?
No!

466
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,245
- No, no, no!
- This will end now.

467
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:30,664
- No! This is dangerous.
- Thunderslam!

468
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:33,867
- Arrgh!
- Oh!

469
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,722
Anything else you need
to talk about?

470
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:42,226
Nope.
That was it.

471
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:50,768
Once again, it's showtime.

472
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:55,773
What baffles me
is how you could

473
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:58,742
take a perfectly good idea,

474
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:02,112
which the great Jo Bennett
rightfully signed off on,

475
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:05,115
and then utterly botch it
in execution.

476
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,401
If I may speak to that,

477
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,920
I have only been Vice President
of this project

478
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:11,288
for the last half hour.

479
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,207
So the man you want
is Dwight Schrute.

480
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:15,176
I don't see Dwight.

481
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,011
He clearly had
the infinite wisdom

482
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:20,681
to stay as far away from
this clown show as possible.

483
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:23,083
Whatever you do...

484
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,436
Do not blame Todd packer.

485
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,689
It is not his fault.

486
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:31,692
Blame his upbringing,
his parents.

487
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,812
The society that would mold
this idiotic creature.

488
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:39,366
Fire the employee, yes.
But not the man.

489
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:42,870
You may not cancel his soul.

490
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:45,122
That was never on the table.

491
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:46,773
Are you kidding?

492
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,576
She's the queen of the whole
friggin' magilla!

493
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,445
And yet, Todd,
it's you who's fired.

494
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:53,581
What--
I can't get fired.

495
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:54,948
I'm an institution.

496
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,917
I have been at this company
for 20 years.

497
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,619
How many of you have been here
that long, huh?

498
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:27,901
Hey, hey!
They're back.

499
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,922
Hey! Wait, Dwight,
what are you doing here?

500
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:33,007
I thought you were supposed
to be in Florida.

501
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,458
Yeah, the crazy thing
about that

502
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:37,578
is, um--
Wow, you look great.

503
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:39,380
- Did you lose some weight?
- Thank you.

504
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:41,838
For someone who actually
notices this.

505
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,926
No, I didn't lose weight,
but I started using my make up

506
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,763
to contour my face
to look skinnier.

507
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:47,214
Actually...

508
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,472
- Hey, good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

509
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:55,776
- Hey, stranger!
- Hey!

510
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:57,738
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you.

511
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:06,921
I'm going to Florida to get Erin.

512
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:14,572
I forgot to check my email.

513
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,046
It's crazy, right? It's just,
when she said she was leaving...

514
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,021
I thought...

515
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,696
You're about to close four tabs,
are you sure you want to continue? Yes.

516
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:22,558
I am sure.

517
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:26,175
Ahh! Slow computer!
