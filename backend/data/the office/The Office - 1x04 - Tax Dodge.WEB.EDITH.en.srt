1
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,320
-Oh. Hi, mate.
-Oh, hi. Yeah. Morning.

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,040
Did you just have a shower?

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,840
No, no, no. Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,240
Jogged in from, home.
So nice to freshen up.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,360
You jogged in from Woy Woy?

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,960
No, no, I, um...

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,400
park a few blocks away
and jog in from the car.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh. I thought I saw your car downstairs.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Yea maybe. Maybe.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
Umm. [awkward pause]

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,320
Yeah, I love jogging. Do you train?

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,760
I sometimes catch the train. Yeah.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,440
Yeah.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,240
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,480
Well, I'll see you around.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,760
Yeah, you definitely will,
because I'll be at my desk all day.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,280
[laughter]

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,440
Okay. Well, I'll see you there.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,600
You will for the next nine hours.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,120
[theme music playing]

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,760
Yeah, so with our stock size cardboard
cartons, we can do 500 to 1000 for $2.45.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,680
And anything over that is $2.35.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,160
-[Deborah] I handle the accounts…
-[Nick] 300 would fit on a pallet.

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,360
She did what?

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,440
Thank you.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,640
Jesus freaking Christ.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,680
[door closes]

28
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,759
Have you registered us as a religion?

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Yes.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,560
[Deborah] Hannah is a riddle.

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,759
Swallowed by an idiot,

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
and shat out by a moron.

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,759
Why would you do that?

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,479
[Hannah] Well, I was reading
about successful billionaires

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,479
and how they avoid paying tax.

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,200
And it's incredible how many ways
you can avoid paying it.

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
Yeah, it's called tax evasion.
It's illegal.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,440
No, no, I mean, these are legitimate
exemptions that you can apply for.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,160
Like, you look
at the criteria for religion.

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,320
It's freaky how similar we are
to a religion already.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
We sell packaging.

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,720
"No idea is so outlandish
that it should not be considered."

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,720
I think.
I think that was Winston Churchill. If I--

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm the person in charge of financials.

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,480
And I'm the person in charge of the person
in charge of financials, what's the...

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,320
problem?

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,079
So you wouldn't be worried
if the ATO sent someone in to investigate?

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,800
-Nope.
-Great.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,960
Because someone from the tax department
is coming in at three.

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Three today?

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
Yeah, but you've got nothing
to worry about, right?

52
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,760
No. I wish they were coming in
at two, actually.

53
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,760
-Why don't I change it to tw--
-No, I've got a meeting at two.

54
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,880
Let's leave it at three. It's good.

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,280
And then they they're checking to see
if we are a...

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,680
Religious organisation.

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,720
-Religious organisation. Thought so.
-Yep.

58
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,880
Religion. Okay.

59
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,680
What are we?

60
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,840
What do religions do?

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,360
[Hannah] I have undertaken the
responsibility of saving this office.

62
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,520
So it's no surprise that my staff
now look to me as a saviour.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
A teacher...

64
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
a therapist, a healer.

65
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,160
And sometimes you just need
to remind people of that.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,040
So that they remind other people.

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,240
People say from like the tax office.

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,160
-[indistinct chatter]
-Welcome.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,680
[Hannah] Yes. Thank you.

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
Thank you so much
for attending this morning.

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,880
It's lovely to start
off the day like this.

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Okay, everyone.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,440
What would you say our
collective focus is?

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,360
-[Lizzie] Boxes.
-[Hannah] Think bigger.

75
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,880
-Big boxes.
-More creative, more abstract.

76
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Like a box
with a tiny moustache and glasses?

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,880
Family. Yeah?

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,280
Love.

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,880
Unity. I mean, we could be selling juice.

80
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
-What kind of juice?
-It doesn't matter,

81
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,240
-I like pineapple.
-[exasperated] What?

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,720
I don't like green smoothies.

83
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
The juice is irrelevant.
Yeah, we could be selling anything,

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,800
but our collective focus would still be…?

85
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,680
Boxes.

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,519
Okay, item number two. Rituals.

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
God, we've got so many
great rituals here, don't we?

88
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,320
We've got meetings.

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,960
-[Lizzie] Recycling.
-[Hannah] Recycling.

90
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,920
Yes, Lizzie. Love that one, actually.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,760
-Morning tea
-Morning tea.

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,200
[Deborah] Time wasting.

93
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,760
Okay, Deborah.

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,360
No need for that.

95
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,000
Three. A leader.

96
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,800
Uh Oh! Whose that? [chuckles]

97
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,680
Number 4. Followers.

98
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,000
My people.

99
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,800
And I look at this and I think,
God, that really sums us up, doesn't it?

100
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,840
But do you know what?
It's actually describing?

101
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,560
A religion.

102
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,560
How did you know that.

103
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,880
Item five is a prayer room.

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Yes, it is. A prayer room.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,800
So I was thinking, God,
we operate so much like a religion,

106
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,480
why don't we just register as one?

107
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,880
[Martin] No, we are not a religion,
Hannah.

108
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,760
Some of us already have a religion.

109
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
I'm Buddhist.

110
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
Oh, Namaste.

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,880
[Hannah] You know what? Doesn't matter.

112
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,040
This is not to replace anyone's religion.
It's to run adjacent.

113
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
You can't force someone
to join a religion.

114
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
Well you can.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,240
But it doesn't end well.

116
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,120
-Is this a tax dodge?
-[Deborah] Yep.

117
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,320
The ATO are coming in today
to shut it down.

118
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,320
[Hannah] Not true.

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,040
We're going to be
operating business as usual.

120
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,400
Just a couple of little tweaks.

121
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,640
Tina, would you like to be in charge
of converting the storeroom

122
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,480
-into a prayer room?
-No.

123
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,440
[Lloyd] Oh, why?
Why would you want to use the storeroom?

124
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,720
What about the toilets?

125
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,560
The toilets?

126
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,159
Show a little respect, Lloyd.

127
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,360
Okay, we're not doing
the prayer room in the toilets.

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,000
Disgusting, actually. Any takers?

129
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,960
[Greta] Love to.

130
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,080
-We'll do it.
-[Hannah] Perfect.

131
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,440
It's like Hannah googled
how to start a religion.

132
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,600
It took a bit of deep diving,
but I think I found it.

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,120
How to start a religion
in eight easy steps.

134
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,160
It's literally the first thing
that comes up.

135
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,520
It says here that religious leaders
offer spiritual and moral guidance

136
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,080
whilst giving back to the community.

137
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
[Hannah] Okay, yep, was just about to
write that down.

138
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,000
Guidance. Don't even have to look.
It's so in my blood.

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,960
Oh, am I writing Hannah?
Am I writing my own name?

140
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,520
Oh, it's charity.
That's how natural it comes to me.

141
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,600
You know what, Marty?

142
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,040
As head of HR,

143
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,680
You're burdened
with a lot of people's problems.

144
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,200
It's not a burden.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,080
And I'm thinking you need someone
to talk to.

146
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,600
To seek some guidance. Yeah?

147
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,880
I want you to think of me like, um,
like pastoral care.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,920
[phones ringing]

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,840
Hey, can you send me an email?

150
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,800
[Lloyd] Yep.

151
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
What about?

152
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,360
Anything.

153
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,680
Okay. [keyboard clacks]

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,320
-And sent.
-[email notification pings]

155
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,760
-Did you get it?
-Nope.

156
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,760
Oh.

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay. Hang on.

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,320
-[email notification pings]
-Get that one?

159
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,640
Nope. [chuckles]

160
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,400
Oh, wonder if it's a server thing
or something.

161
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
[email notification pings]

162
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,960
[Deborah] Seeing as Hannah is apparently
now head of financials.

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,720
I am forwarding her all of my emails.

164
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,960
And I will be making sure
she gets a lot of them.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,960
It's a bit of a community service
what we do here, isn't it?

166
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,680
-[email notification pings]
-It's a, it's a job.

167
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
-This is a business.
-[email notification pings]

168
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
It's a family business.

169
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,440
-Like the...

170
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,960
-[email notification pings]
-Smith family or the Vinnies family

171
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,840
Or the Salvos family.

172
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,720
They're an army.
-[email notification pings twice]

173
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
-You gonna check your emails?

174
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,400
-Hmm.

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,640
[Hannah] Ah, Deb.

177
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,600
[Deborah] You're interrupting
my sacred ritual.

178
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,240
And it won't happen again.

179
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,200
Something kooky is going on.
I keep getting your emails.

180
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,400
Really?

181
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,440
And I got, like, 15 from Lloyd
that just say doggy doo doo.

182
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
Well, that is strange.

183
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,040
Okay, I can see that you're
going through something.

184
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,680
[Breathes deeply] Umm,
is everything all right at home?

185
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,000
-A bit tricky with the old ball and chain.
-Yeah.

186
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,760
That's it.

187
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,320
Ooh, sorry.

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
Good luck with your fraud.

189
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,680
Oh it's-- It's not fraud. Oh, no.
[door slams]

190
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,960
[knocks]

191
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,440
Yoo hoo.

192
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,000
Hey, do you want two new hole punches?

193
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,880
-Oh, put them on my desk, please.
-Got it.

194
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,799
[Greta] Would you like five old phones?

195
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,400
[Nick] Err, just give me four.

196
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,799
[exclaims]

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,320
Is someone sleeping in here?

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Yeah, that would be Lloyd.

199
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,920
-Yeah, that checks out.
-Yep.

200
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,560
[Lloyd] The daily commute from Woy Woy is
killing me,

201
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
so I've spent a couple of nights
in the storeroom.

202
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
I don't want everyone knowing about it.

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,160
It's not a big deal.
It's been one, two, three...

204
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,640
Four-- yeah, four nights this week.

205
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,880
It's nothing.

206
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,480
[strains]

207
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,200
Eww. What the hell is that stain?

208
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,960
Oh, hopefully nothing to do with Lloyd.

209
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,160
[chuckles]
Actually, kind of looks like Hannah.

210
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh, my God, it does eh?
[Greta laughs]

211
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,520
[Lizzie] Oi You two, this isn't a disco.
Get back to work.

212
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,120
Wait, Lizzie.

213
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,440
We think we may have found an apparition.

214
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,840
-[Nick] Oh, yes.
-It's just a stain.

215
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,960
No, no, no, it wasn't there when we
started.

216
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
It's like it just appeared out of nowhere.

217
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,640
And it kind of looks like Hannah,
don't you think?

218
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,680
I don't see it.

219
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,280
Oh. Try squinting.

220
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,600
You know the thing about apparitions?

221
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,600
You confess your deepest, darkest secrets
to them, and you get rewarded.

222
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,120
Yeah. Maybe I should try it.

223
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,920
You totally should.
-Mm-hmm.

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,040
-Stand back.
-Oh.

225
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,680
I once took three plates of nigiri off
a sushi train, and I didn't pay for it.

226
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
Thief!

227
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's see what gift the gods bring,
shall we?

228
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
[Nick] We shall.

229
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,480
Oh, would you feel that?

230
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
[Greta shivers] Oh.

231
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
Idiots.

232
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,880
Hannah.

233
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,280
-[lift dings]
-Ding!

234
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,400
All right, everybody,

235
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,800
it is time for my regular
op shop drop off.

236
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,160
[Deborah] By regular, you mean first ever?

237
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,840
[bag rustles]

238
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,800
Lizzie, would you like to make a donation?

239
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Err, I can donate some staples.

240
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
Chuck them in.
No such thing as a bad donation.

241
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,160
Lloyd, would you like to make a donation?

242
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,600
Oh, I could I could draw you a picture.

243
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,040
Right. There's an example of a bad
donation.

244
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,360
We're always learning. Thank you Lloyd.

245
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,680
Marty! Donation?

246
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,080
I think that might be a no. All right.

247
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,680
Hey, Tina. Tina Arena.

248
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,520
You know what I love about,
eastern spirituality?

249
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,840
-My sandwich.
-Huh?

250
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,440
You're sitting on my sandwich.

251
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,600
Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm sorry.

252
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,320
-Um…
-You can donate it.

253
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,520
I'll get another one.

254
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,560
[Hannah] Okay.

255
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,120
[bag rustles]

256
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,720
[Greta] Here she comes.

257
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm sorry. How many corrugated mailer
boxes do you want?

258
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,560
[snaps, fingers]
[whispers ] Pen, pen.

259
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,760
10,000?

260
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,240
Whoa. No.

261
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,840
No. Thank you so much for your business.
I really appreciate it.

262
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,800
You have a lovely day. Thank you.

263
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,080
That was my best ever sale.

264
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,400
-Really?
-Yeah.

265
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,840
Wait, you didn't think
it was because of the...

266
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,320
Surely not.

267
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,320
I did confess, and then I got the sale.

268
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,840
[chair squeaks]

269
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,720
Oh, Sebastian, can you take this bag

270
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,520
and the bag next to Lloyd's desk
with his donations

271
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
and then just follow me?

272
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,560
-Sorry.
-Yeah, just grab those two bags.

273
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,600
Follow me.

274
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
-[lift dings]
-[Hannah] I love giving back.

275
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Off we go.

276
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,320
It's just so great seeing the gratitude on
their faces, hearing them say thank you.

277
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,480
You saved our lives.

278
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,080
Not that that's why I do it, but.

279
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, I'd be annoyed
if they didn't say anything.

280
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,960
[keyboards clacking]

281
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,760
Hey Deborah.

282
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,720
-Have you seen--
-No.

283
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,120
It's a light green plastic bag.

284
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,080
Have you seen that around at all?

285
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,800
Alright.

286
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,840
Knock, knock.

287
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,240
Who's there? Opportunity.

288
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,440
[woman] Finley who?

289
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,560
Flinley Craddick.

290
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,440
-Finley. Finn.
-Flin-- It's two L's. Flinley.

291
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
-Fin.
-Flin.

292
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,360
-Flinley.
-Finley.

293
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,960
It doesn't even matter.

294
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,720
Should we just drop them
like it's hot here?

295
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,080
As per yoozh?

296
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Why not take them through
to the back to Malcolm?

297
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,160
[sarcastically]
He'll sort through them, as per yoozh.

298
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay. Don't need, don't need that.

299
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,400
Well, this is a bit more like it,
isn't it?

300
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Tea towels on the door.
You should have a look in there.

301
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,800
There's some very good stuff
in there, my friend.

302
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,120
Oh, belt, belt. Good accessories.

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,040
Oh, Swannies Beanie.

304
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,760
[sings Sydney Swans theme song]

305
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,760
Is that Martin's?

306
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,880
No, not, not Martin's.

307
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,280
I'm sorry, folks,
we can't take wet clothes.

308
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Well, I don't think that they're wet.

309
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,200
[gags]

310
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,480
Umm, don't know
where we got this bag from.

311
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,600
Probably accidentally picked it up.

312
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,400
I think that's Lloyd's bag.

313
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,200
[Hannah] Let's put the underpants away.

314
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,480
God, it just…feels good
to give back to community, doesn't it?

315
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,720
Yeah. I don't really have a choice
in the matter.

316
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,200
What... was that?

317
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,920
Community service.
It's part of my parole deal.

318
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Meaning the old slammer.

319
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,880
What for?

320
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,880
Sebastian.

321
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,920
Don't. We don't ask those questions.

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,360
That's not appropriate.

323
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,240
Now that he said it though, like out loud.
What--?

324
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,920
[Malcom] Don't worry. It wasn't murder.
[chuckles]

325
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,280
Nah. Tax evasion.

326
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,200
Oh.

327
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,320
So I got nine years for it.

328
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,640
That seems like a lot.

329
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Ruined my life.

330
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
[chokes up] I lost everything.

331
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,760
-[Malcolm] If I could go back,
-Yeah.

332
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,360
I would do it all differently.

333
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,680
Would you?

334
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,200
Well, speaking of going back.

335
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,400
Ooh, sandwich.

336
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,720
What do you reckon
we hit the road Sebastian?

337
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,280
Malcolm. Great to meet you.

338
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,160
Good to see
that you came out of it unscathed.

339
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,320
Well, hardly unscathed.

340
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,240
I haven't told you
about my first night in the cell.

341
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,360
Three guards busted in on me.

342
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,800
Jesus Christ!

343
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,160
[footsteps recede hurriedly]

344
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,320
[Lizzie] Once when I was secretary
of my body corporate,

345
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,800
I had an elderly woman evicted
for hanging tea towels off her balcony.

346
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
She died a week later but...

347
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,800
rules are rules so...

348
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,840
[whispers] Thank you.

349
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
[office hubbub]

350
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,960
[Greta] The fish is on the hook.

351
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
[phones ring, printer whirrs]

352
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,880
[mutters under breath] No way.

353
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
-[package rustles]
-[Greta] Oh, what's that?

354
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,200
[Nick] I've got no idea.

355
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,080
[gasps]

356
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,360
[quietly] Shut up!

357
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
That’s, that's my hat.

358
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,560
[Nick] So that was a Moncler hat.
I bought with a voucher

359
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,160
my parents got me for my birthday.

360
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,360
It was stupidly expensive,

361
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,520
[incredulously]
and now Lizzie's wearing it.

362
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,080
[Hannah] Can you just Google something?

363
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,520
Can you just Google,
religion, tax fraud, jail?

364
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,320
Just pop that in.

365
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,880
What's umm, what's coming up?

366
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,600
Yeah, I mean, it's mostly stories
of people going to jail for fraud.

367
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,360
[Hannah] Oh my god.
Okay, let's Google something nice.

368
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,240
Kids auditioning for singing contests.

369
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,880
You see how they...you've seen them?

370
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,200
-[Hannah] Oh, my God, that's him.
-[Sebastian] Who?

371
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,359
That's the ATO guy.
It's got to be him, right?

372
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,079
It looks like he's got
that tax stank on him.

373
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,720
Maybe we should just drive to Canberra,
start a new life.

374
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
Tassie. Is that better?

375
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,960
Maybe we should just tell them
it was a mistake.

376
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,400
-[Hannah] Yeah, Ok
-I'm sure. They'll be understanding.

377
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,000
Actually...

378
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,120
How hard do you think it would be to,
I don't know, like change identity or...

379
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
-[Sebastian] Umm.
-Like, could I, could I be a Carmen?

380
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,560
Would I be a Patricia?

381
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,240
-Might be difficult.
-You think?

382
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,440
-Yeah.
-All right.

383
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,480
-Let's just.
-Okay.

384
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Yeah, yeah.

385
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,840
You know what?
I think I'm going to go up the back way.

386
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,840
[keypad beeps, door closes]

387
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
[office chatter]

388
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,160
-[Nick] Hi, Hannah.
-[mutters]

389
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,720
-Hey, Hannah.
-[mutters]

390
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,120
What is going on today?

391
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,360
Thank you so much for coming in.
I'm grateful.

392
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,520
Cheers. Thank you.

393
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,360
[footsteps]

394
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,320
Hey guys. Sorry to interrupt.

395
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Has anyone seen my Swans beanie?

396
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,520
Was just hanging up in my office.
It means quite a lot to me.

397
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,040
My son gave it to me.

398
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,160
It's like a red and white woolly hat.

399
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,840
She's donated it, hasn't she?

400
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,920
[Greta] Hey, Lizzie. What's up?

401
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,360
Just went and had a little visit
with the apparition

402
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,240
to score myself some more stuff.

403
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
Yeah. About that. Umm...

404
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
I ordered that exact same hat
three days ago.

405
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,280
Your point?

406
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
It's mine. I ordered it online.

407
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,920
Sounds like a tall story, Nick.

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,760
Lizzie. The whole stain thing was a joke.

409
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,800
Apparitions are no joke. Nick.

410
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,200
You are the joke.

411
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,240
An apparition?

412
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,080
Oh, no, I think there might be some
soy sauce I spilt one night.

413
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,760
I tried to clean it up,
but I think I made it worse.

414
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,320
Karma?

415
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,120
If it is, yours is coming.
Cause you were in on it too.

416
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,480
[tinkly phone ringtone]
[feint dance music]

417
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,400
Hey, babe.

418
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,920
-Hey, baby girl. Guess what?
-What?

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,200
[Car horn blares]

420
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,400
[laughs] Did you hear that?

421
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,120
Yes, I can hear that.

422
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
All right. Here's the deal right?

423
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,800
So you know you said that you want
to spend more time together?

424
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,640
Shauny's organised a bowling night,

425
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,000
and then we're going to go back
to Tommy's after for pizzas.

426
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,760
[Greta] Oh, great, time together with
Shauny and Tommy, cool.

427
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,240
Yeah. Come down so pack up whatever you're
doing and let's go eh?

428
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,200
-Hurry up.
-Sure.

429
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,720
Yeah. Give me a couple of minutes okay?

430
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,160
Karma calling?

431
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,240
No comment.

432
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,720
Bye.

433
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,400
This could be bad Hannah.

434
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,400
[Hannah] How bad?

435
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,920
Jail bad?

436
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,640
Are we both going down?

437
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,920
Well, no, I'm off the hook.

438
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,240
Oh, my God. Damn it.

439
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,080
I mean, it's great. It's great for you.

440
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,800
Do you--
Did you tell him it was just a mistake?

441
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,080
But you don't make mistakes.

442
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,120
Well, that's not entirely true.

443
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
I make mistakes. On, on occasion.
Such as this occasion.

444
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,040
-He did give me a phone number.
-[Hannah] He did?

445
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,760
But do not hang up.
Doesn't matter how long it takes.

446
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,520
You need to talk to someone there today.

447
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,800
Okay.

448
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,080
Okay. Yeah.

449
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,360
[quietly] Oh god.

450
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,120
Thank you Deb.

451
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
[Hannah] Hey, Deb.

452
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,360
Bless you.

453
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,200
[Deborah] Total bullshit.

454
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,880
I explained the situation. He went away.

455
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,760
Phone number was bullshit too.

456
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,320
Some tech nerd legend created a line
that only leads to hold music.

457
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,720
[phone line ringing]

458
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,720
[hold muzak]

459
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,360
[Lloyd] Probably a good thing I got
evicted.

460
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,560
I might take off actually.

461
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,360
Traffic's going to be building up on the
motorway.

462
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,400
It's a long drive so might listen to a
true crime podcast or something.

463
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,760
Anyway. Have a good weekend.

464
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,480
[hold muzak]

465
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,240
[muzak stops]

466
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,320
Oh, Hel--
[hold muzak starts]

467
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,080
[automated voice]
Your call is important to us.

468

[theme music playing]
