1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,880
[Nick] Oh, morning, Lizzie.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,960
Installing a security camera
in the kitchen, are we?

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,320
What I'm doing, Nick,
is none of your concern.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,640
Someone been stealing your Tasmanian stew?

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,280
Stew is not from Tasmania,
it is from everywhere.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,480
[Lizzie] The most important factor
in catching a perpetrator

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,240
is video evidence of wrongdoing.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,920
The perpetrator in this instance
is the disgusting individual

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,680
who has been using the jaffle maker
and not cleaning it afterwards.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,240
I bet it's Lloyd.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,240
[theme music playing]

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,240
[roadway noise]

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,160
[elevator dings]

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,040
Good morning, Flinley Craddick!

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,680
What excitement awaits us today,
young Elizabeth?

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,280
Um… nothing in the calendar.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,320
No meetings?

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
No.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,840
Any messages?

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,039
-[Lizzie] From…?
-Anyone?

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,160
No.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
[tapping]

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,640
"Must have coffee."

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,480
-[Tina] I'm just not enjoying it.
-So, you're resigning?

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,400
I'm thinking about it, yes.

26
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,400
[Tina] My friend Mel resigned last month.

27
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,960
She's with another company now.

28
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,120
She's much happier.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,920
I have their details if you want them.
They're recruiting.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
[Deborah] Yeah, put them on through.

31
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,440
They had an away day last Friday.
Ziplining.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,920
[Deborah] Oh, sweet!

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
[notification chimes]

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,120
That's it.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,680
Oh Lloyd, you little rat.
[Lizzie imitates a rat] Ah!

36
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,479
[phone ringing]

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,960
-Hello, Hannah.
-We have a problem.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,320
Come into my office, please.
Come into my office.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,720
[Lizzie] Yeah, okay.

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,120
What's the sitchenario?

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,080
That's my word.

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,240
Yep. Sorry.

43
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,840
The sitchenario is this.

44
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,960
I was in the kitchen,
and I overheard Tina.

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,800
-And she's going to resign.
-Traitor.

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,200
And she's gonna take
half the staff with her.

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,680
Okay, let her resign,

48
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,600
but I'll do the exit interview.

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
She'll be crying like a baby
when I'm done.

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,000
[Hannah] Um…Yeah.

51
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,680
Yeah, I was actually thinking about
doing something fun

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,680
to prevent a mass exodus.

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,160
How much is ziplining?

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,280
You will not find a ziplining experience
for less than $75 per person.

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,120
Well, that's too expensive. Okay.

56
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,560
All right, I need you to plan
a fun away day activity,

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,840
including lunch and transport,

58
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,040
$500 max.

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,320
Give me a date.

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Today.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Too easy.

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,079
-And Lizzie?
-Yeah?

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,040
Nothing with guns this time.

64
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
Copy that.

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,079
[Mason] Come on, baby,
just take a day off.

66
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,640
I don't understand. It's like
you're literally obsessed with this place.

67
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,440
[Greta] I work here, Mason.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,520
This is my job. I get paid to be here.

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,600
[Mason] Babe! Baby girl!

70
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,440
Guys! Big announcement.

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,160
Can I have a drumroll, please?

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
That's not a drumroll, Lloyd.

73
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,440
That's how I drumroll.

74
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Sebastian, can you do a drumroll, please?

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,960
-Yeah, on your legs.
-[Greta sniffling]

76
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,600
On your legs, everyone.

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
[Hannah] Mm? Mm? Mm? Mm? Mm? Mm?

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,480
[softly] Are you okay?

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,079
[the "drumroll" continues]

80
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,280
[mimics firework noises]

81
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,240
We are going on a surprise away day!

82
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,480
What? Yep!

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,440
Impromptu excursion where we will
self-develop, bond, and have fun!

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,640
Where are we going?

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,880
Um…?

86
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,240
That is for me to know
and for you to find out.

87
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,040
-When?
-[Hannah] When we get there.

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
-Get where?
-Look, all you need to know is,

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,160
it's happening outside of this building.

90
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,400
Okay, well, we're gonna need
a health and safety plan.

91
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,680
Well, then, plan it, Martin.

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,720
I will be taking my first aid kit
and my taser.

93
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,680
We will be fine.

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,680
-How'd you get a taser?
-We're not having a taser.

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,520
I wouldn't mind having a crack
at axe throwing.

96
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,840
[Hannah] Yep,
we're not doing axe throwing.

97
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,160
-It's not an escape room, is it?
-It is not an escape room.

98
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,640
Thank you, Sebastian.

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
Ziplining?

100
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,720
Ziplining? Did I hear ziplining?

101
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,600
Tina!

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
You're backing me into a corner here.

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm not allowed to say anything,
but… [coughs] …maybe.

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,560
[indistinct chatter]

105
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,040
Do you think Tina's having a good time?

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
-She, she's standing by herself.
-[Lizzie] I mean, I don't know.

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,360
-We haven't left the car park yet, so.

108
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,840
-[Greta sighs heavily]
-You want to talk about it?

109
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,880
-Not really.
-That's cool.

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,720
I too myself am a big fan
of the repress-don't-express method.

111
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,680
I feel pain, I just push it
down, down, down.

112
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,480
Mason's Nan is sick, so we spent
all weekend at the hospital.

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,120
Which, of course we would.

114
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,800
But then this morning,
Mason wanted me to stay home

115
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
to help him tile the bathroom

116
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,560
because he didn't get time to do it
over the weekend.

117
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,360
Okay, everyone!

118
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,760
Attention, please!

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
The bus has now arrived.

120
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,920
Please take note of the seating chart.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,960
Any questions?

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Yeah, why do we have a seating chart plan?

123
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,400
To ensure equal weight distribution
on the vehicle.

124
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,680
Next question!

125
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,680
Isn't that just for light planes?

126
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,680
Trust me, I've done the research.

127
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,360
Oh, we trust you. Question.

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Were you in The Matrix?

129
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,080
-Next question!
-Okay, no more questions.

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah? Um…

131
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Breaking news, folks.

132
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,440
There's a new award up for grabs.
Best Away Day Employee.

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,680
And I don't want to say who's gonna win,
but there's an early frontrunner.

134
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,800
Her name's Tina.

135
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
[Hannah] Ooh!

136
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,120
-[Lizzie] Okay, everyone on the bus.
-Yes!

137
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
[indistinct, unenthusiastic chatter]

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,159
Where are we going?

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,640
-Not telling.
-Zorbing?

140
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,280
I don't think you understand
the concept of surprise.

141
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,800
-Biscuit factory.
-[Lizzie] Please get on the bus, Lloyd.

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,880
[softly] I need you to find me
a destination.

143
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,520
-[Lizzie] On it.
-Stat.

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,720
Got your little suncream,
have you, Martin?

145
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,440
[Martin] Look, I know it's very exciting.

146
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,840
We are on a trip.

147
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,680
But please stay in your seats
and just keep your belts on.

148
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,080
I got plenty of sunscreen here,
so don't be afraid to come on up.

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,400
And when we cross the road,
let's do it in a group, okay?

150
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,560
Thank you.

151
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,600
[Hannah] Thanks, Marty!

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
-Just gonna go and have a chat to Tina.
-Yeah.

153
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,560
[Hannah grunts]

154
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,800
Seatbelt.

155
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,640
-Hey, Sebastian.
-Mm?

156
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,320
Um, there's a spare seat up the front.

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,920
It's pretty cool.
You can see where we're going.

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,600
Uh… no, I'm good,
I've been on a bus before.

159
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,760
Thanks.

160
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,080
Right. Yep.

161
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,040
[sighs]

162
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,920
Teens, where do you see yourself
in five years?

163
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,440
Maybe if you work hard enough,
you can take my job.

164
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,960
No, thanks.

165
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
Okay.

166
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,920
[snores]

167
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,880
[Greta chuckles]

168
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,440
[phone dings]

169
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,320
[laughs]

170
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,640
Cone of silence. How's it going?

171
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,440
Well, naturally, I assumed
the jaffle culprit was one of our own,

172
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,400
but, turns out it's Grubby Mitts Jonny
from the warehouse.

173
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,200
What are you talking about?
I mean the away day destination.

174
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,640
Oh. Well, there's only two places
that we can afford.

175
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,200
One, an interactive reptile experience,

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,560
or a bakery tour called "Gluten Tootin".

177
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,520
That's it?

178
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,640
For five hundred bucks
including lunch? Yes.

179
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,640
[sighs heavily] Okay.

180
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,440
Testing.

181
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,920
Um, hi, everyone!

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,480
Uh, it's time for the big announcement.

183
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,440
We are going to an interactive
reptile experience

184
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
with a fully catered lunch!

185
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,520
Yay!

186
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,680
When I say "reptile",
you say "experience"!

187
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,640
-Reptile!
-[Lloyd and Lizzie] Experience.

188
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
[Hannah] Okay.

189
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,680
Let's go, everybody.

190
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,640
Hey! G'day!

191
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,920
-[Hannah] Hi.
-I'm Phil.

192
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,800
[Phil] How's it going?

193
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,080
-Yep.
-[Phil] All right.

194
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,640
This is my dog, Shane.

195
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,080
-Everyone say, "Hello, Shane."
-[Shane barks]

196
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
-Hello, Shane.
-[Phil] Shane's saying hello to you.

197
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,760
Now, Shane's not dangerous,

198
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
but if you go through
that gate over there,

199
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,680
then it's a completely different
fuckin' story, all right?

200
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Could Shane be on a lead while we're here?

201
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,040
Nah, I don't believe
in tying animals up, mate.

202
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
It's all right,
just don't go through the gate.

203
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,040
Okay, and where are the toilets?

204
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,880
Ah, just around the side of the house.

205
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,160
-Through the gate.
-[Phil] Yeah.

206
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,000
All right, just head 'round this way.

207
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
[Hannah] Okay, yeah.

208
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,840
-"Shane".
-[hushed] Lizzie, what is this place?

209
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,240
It's… it's Phil's Reptile Park.

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,720
[upbeat exciting music playing]

211
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
[Phil] Welcome to…

212
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,120
Phil's snake and reptile experience!

213
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,720
Experience… experience…

214
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,440
Okay, inside this garage
are some of Australia's

215
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,960
most dangerous animals.

216
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Excuse me.

217
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,040
[music stops]

218
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,160
Yeah, mate?

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,200
Do you have, ah, funnel web spiders?

220
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,960
-No. No.
-[Lloyd] No?

221
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,920
Do you have, ah, box jellyfish?

222
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,920
Is a box jellyfish a reptile, mate?

223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
-No, but you said--
-[Hannah] Lloyd?

224
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,400
You're actually ruining it for Tina and I.
We're just trying to have fun.

225
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,040
Aren't we?

226
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
[Lloyd] You can't say, "I've got
Australia's most dangerous animals",

227
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,400
and then not actually have any
of Australia's most dangerous animals.

228
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,240
Do you have a taipan? No.

229
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,080
Do you have a saltwater croc? No.

230
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,760
Do you have a redback? No.

231
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,000
Doesn't even have a cassowary.

232
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,280
[Phil] Okay, everybody, this is Tammy.

233
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,280
-Hello!
-She's an albino carpet python.

234
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,520
AKA, Morelia spilota.

235
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,400
Now, who wants to have a hold?

236
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,400
I do!

237
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,920
Oh, that's what I like to see.
Keen as mustard.

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,120
-Yes! [laughs]
-[Phil] Very nice.

239
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,920
[in Dobby's accent] "The Chamber
of Secrets has been opened."

240
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
[in normal voice] What was that?
You want to go around Nick's neck?

241
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,720
-Okay.
-Oh, just like… just here's fine, Lizzie.

242
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,440
-[Phil] Go for it, She's a sweetheart.
-Do you want to touch?

243
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,480
-It's like a dog. You just pat it.
-Okay. Thank you.

244
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,440
-There we go, thanks very much.
-[Hannah] I'll have a turn.

245
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,440
-[Nick] Yeah? Okay.
-[Hannah] Yeah, here we go.

246
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,080
-Yeah, around my neck.
-Oh, neck? Okay.

247
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,480
Oh, wow. Yep.

248
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,960
Ooh. Yep.

249
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
I feel… fertile.

250
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,880
I think that's the best way
to describe it.

251
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,560
Tina, you are gonna love this, honestly.

252
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
You get it?

253
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,640
You getting it?

254
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,400
-Yeah. Oh, get a photo.
-Yeah? Okay.

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
-Hashtag snake sisters.
-[Lizzie] Yeah, okay.

256
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,560
Go like this! [hisses]

257
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,680
[hisses]

258
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,640
[upbeat rock music playing]

259
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay, strap in, folks. This is Jacob,

260
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,480
an Eastern Brown snake,
aka Pseudonaja textilis,

261
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,440
the most deadliest snake in the world.

262
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,560
More like top ten.

263
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,840
One bite from Jacob and it's fuckin'
goodnight nurse, all right?

264
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,760
So, I'll just put him down here

265
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,280
so you guys can have
a good look at him, all right?

266
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,840
Careful, Jacob. Where you goin', mate?

267
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,760
That's it.

268
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,800
-Oh…
-[Phil] Enjoy yourselves.

269
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
[Martin] We might need that hook.

270
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,760
-[Hannah] Look at this.
-[Nick] Um, Phil…?

271
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,000
-Sorry mate, he's on the move.
-[all exclaiming]

272
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,560
[Phil] It's all right, it's all right.

273
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,120
Just stand still and relax.

274
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,320
It's all good.
Snakes have got terrible eyesight.

275
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,360
Not true.

276
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,720
[all exclaiming]

277
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,680
[Nick yelps]

278
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
You okay?

279
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,000
[Lizzie] If only I had my taser.

280
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,560
-You can't taser a snake.
-You can if it's threatening your liberty.

281
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,480
Remember, he's more scared of you
than you are of him.

282
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,200
[Hannah]
I bet this doesn't happen every day.

283
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,120
All right, no, he's heading to
the neighbours' chook house for a feed.

284
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,160
[Phil] Come back here, you little bugger.

285
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,720
-[Phil] Look out!
-Memories.

286
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,320
[Phil] Everybody, get back.

287
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,880
[Martin] Maybe just let him go, Phil.

288
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,600
[Hannah] I think he knows
what he's doing, Martin.

289
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,520
[Phil groans]

290
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,720
Get the anti-venom! It's by the CD player.

291
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,400
Okay. Move. Move.

292
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,080
Move! Out the way. Move!

293
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
Hey, Phil, can I just check,

294
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
is this part of the show
or have you actually been bitten?

295
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Either way, incredible performance.

296
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,400
Don't you think, Tina?

297
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,320
-[Phil] Where's the anti-venom?
-[Lizzie] On my way! On my way!

298
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
On my way!

299
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,800
[Phil] Jesus.

300
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,680
-In the neck? Straight…
-No, give it here.

301
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,200
[Phil grunts]

302
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,920
[grunts]

303
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,960
Very good.

304
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Man, everything but a first aid kit.

305
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,200
[Greta rummages]

306
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Got these?

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm okay, I'm saving myself for lunch.

308
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
Ha, ha. Sit up here.

309
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
[sighs]

310
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,560
[Nick] Mmm!

311
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,120
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

312
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,400
Do you think Tina's having fun?

313
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,280
[Lizzie] Um… I don't think so,
but it's also Tina, so it's hard to tell.

314
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,400
[Hannah] Okay.

315
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,320
-[phone ringing]
-Hungry?

316
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,440
No thanks, I have to take this.

317
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
[Hannah sighs]

318
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,400
[hushed] Okay. Everyone, come here.
Come here, quickly.

319
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,480
[Hannah] Okay.

320
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm worried about Tina, okay?

321
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,040
I think she's very unwell.

322
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,440
I think she's been caught up
in a pyramid scheme

323
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,120
and she's gonna try and recruit you.

324
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,360
Of course, she's gonna dress it up
as a job opportunity.

325
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,760
Do not take it under any circumstances.

326
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,080
It's very sad,
but we just have to ignore it.

327
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,400
Just gotta, you know…

328
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,040
[brightly] Tina!

329
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,760
That was a quick call. How was it?

330
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,280
-Okay.
-[Phil] Ah, guys?

331
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,800
I hope you're enjoying the sambos.

332
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,320
Now, look, forgot to mention,

333
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,960
the bedroom on the left down the hall
is the gift shop.

334
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,520
Come and get a keyring, a stubby holder.

335
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,640
In fact, everything in the house is
for sale, so make an offer!

336
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,120
-[Hannah] Whoo!
-What about these tongs?

337
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
[Phil] Eight bucks.

338
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,920
-What about the oven mitt?
-Four bucks.

339
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,400
Honestly, everything's for sale.

340
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
Make me an offer. Come find me.

341
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,440
[Hannah sighs]

342
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,960
Do you think they missed us?

343
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,400
-[laughing] No.
-[laughs]

344
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,720
We could be dead on the floor,
riddled with venom.

345
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,640
-Yeah.
-And nobody would know.

346
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,520
[Greta laughs]

347
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Um…

348
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,080
Gonna change my arm.

349
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
Keep my biceps even.

350
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,240
No, I can do it. I can do it. I can do it.

351
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,640
[plastic crinkling]

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,840
[Nick] Mm…

353
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,280
Do you like peas?

354
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,480
Is that where we're at?

355
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
Chatting about peas?

356
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,360
Mm.

357
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,440
[Lloyd] Oop, g'day, guys.

358
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,600
-[Nick] Oh, hey, Lloyd.
-[Lloyd] Yes! There it is. Yes.

359
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,360
He only wants ten bucks for that.

360
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
That is incredibly cheap meat.

361
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,040
[Nick laughs] Yeah.

362
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,320
You gonna, um…?

363
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,840
-No, they're all yours.
-You know?

364
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,960
Sweet!

365
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
[Nick] Mm.

366
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,720
-Lloyd's dinner is already set, isn't it?
-Yes, yeah.

367
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,520
-Sunday… Sunday night roast, yes.
-Saturday night roast, yeah.

368
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,800
Whoa.

369
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,520
[tablet chimes]

370
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,960
Oh, you sneaky little man.

371
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,440
Oh my…

372
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,200
[phone ringing]

373
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Pick up, Jonny, I dare you.
Pick up, you little chicken.

374
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,240
[Jonny speaking indistinctly]

375
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,400
[Lizzie] That's it.

376
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,320
[Jonny] Goodbye.

377
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,960
[scoffs]

378
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,840
Oh, really unimpressed, Jonny.

379
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,040
Really unimpressed now.

380
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,360
-[slurping]
-You said I was unwell.

381
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,000
-Did I?
-Yes.

382
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, at least I'm not a traitor.

383
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,520
Oh, come on.

384
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
She's threatening a mutiny.

385
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,560
What are you talking about?

386
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,480
She is gonna quit
and take the whole staff with her,

387
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,160
and she just wants to go and find someone
who'll take her ziplining.

388
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,920
Well, you know what, Tina?

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,040
Goodbye, and good luck

390
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
finding a boss like this

391
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,160
again.

392
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,040
-[Tina] I'm not quitting.
-Mm?

393
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,120
I work part-time
for a Chinese-language newspaper.

394
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,440
That's the job I'm thinking of quitting.

395
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,440
Okay, so…

396
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,280
so you're not leaving Flinley Craddick?

397
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
No.

398
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,400
Oh…

399
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,880
Okay.

400
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Well.

401
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,440
Sounds like someone made a dummy.
Someone made a boo-boo.

402
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,840
Hey, shall we have a little sorry hug?

403
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,640
-No, thanks.
-[Hannah] No.

404
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,960
-Martin?
-No.

405
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,880
[sighs]

406
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,400
[Sebastian]
You've never had a pair of tongs before?

407
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,800
[Lloyd] No, I never use tongs.

408
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,120
What do you normally use for tongs?

409
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Either my fingers or a spatula.

410
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
-You use a spatula to pick things up?
-[Lloyd] Yeah.

411
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,280
Got you a memento.

412
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,000
[Greta laughs] Okay.

413
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,000
-And it was only eight bucks.
-[Greta] Ooh.

414
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,960
-That's a… bargain.
-Mm-hmm.

415
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,000
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

416
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,440
[Hannah] Ah, guys? Guys?

417
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,440
Um, I forgot to present
the Best Away Day Employee.

418
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,680
Ah, this gift is for Tina.

419
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,800
-[all clapping]
-[indistinct chatter]

420
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,760
[Hannah] Yeah?
Ooh, don't touch the bottom.

421
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,560
It's Tammy!

422
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,320
I have a Dwarf bunny rabbit at home.

423
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,160
Not compatible.

424
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,160
What is your refund policy?

425
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,880
Don't have one.

426
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,040
I'll buy it off you for fifty bucks.

427
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,960
Fifty bucks?

428
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,160
Can we hurry up, please?
The meat's starting to thaw.

429
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,480
[Phil] All right, well.

430
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,760
Come again.
Make sure you tell your friends.

431
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,880
Yep. We won't.

432
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Thank you.

433
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,560
[Hannah] Has it been
a successful away day?

434
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,000
I'd say yes.

435
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,960
It wasn't ziplining,

436
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,640
who would have remembered that?

437
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
No one.

438
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,400
You know what people remember?

439
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,800
A grown man

440
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,680
being bitten by a venomous snake.

441
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,840
That's…

442
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,360
That's going in there forever.

443
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,120
Tina.

444
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,280
She'll remember.

445
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,680
See ya, Sebastian.

446
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,280
-See ya, Deb. Lloyd.
-See ya.

447
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,680
Love ya shank.

448
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,440
-Bye, Greta. Nick.
-[Greta] Bye.

449
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
[Hannah] See ya, James.

450
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
[Josh mutters] Josh.

451
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,960
See ya, Tina.

452
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,960
-Long distance high five.
-[Tina scoffs]

453
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,240
[grunts, pretends to whimper in pain]

454
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,560
[indistinct chatter]

455
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,760
[clears throat]

456
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,520
I've got a little surprise for Jonny.

457
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,000
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

458
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,640
Yeah, like Milos?

459
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,200
Yeah, we could go to Milos.

460
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,400
But I think Parramatta is,
like, more achievable.

461
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,520
We could go for dinner.

462
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,120
Yeah. That could be fun.

463
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Yeah.

464
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,320
-[phone ringing]
-Ooh.

465
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,920
-Sorry, I should, um…
-Yeah, of course.

466
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,160
-[Greta] Hey.
-[Mason indistinct on phone]

467
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Oh no!

468
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,440
Oh, babe, I'm so sorry.

469
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,880
[Mason] I'll pick you up
if you're still at work.

470
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,720
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be here.

471
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
[Nick] Everything okay?

472
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Um…

473
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,000
Mason's Teta has died.

474
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,280
Oh, I'm so sorry.

475
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,000
Can we just pretend this…

476
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,400
whole thing didn't… didn't happen?

477
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,800
Yeah, of course. Yeah, sure.

478
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,280
Yeah.

479
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,640
Um, Mason's picking me up, so.

480
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,200
Oh.

481
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,520
[Greta sighs]

482
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,480
I'll drop it back off at Phil's then.

483
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,240
[roadway noise]

484
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,640
[yelps]

485
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Bloody hell!

486
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,680
[theme music]
