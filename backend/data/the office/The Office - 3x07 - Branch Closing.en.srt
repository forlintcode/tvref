1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:02,975
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,068 --> 00:00:06,176
Who are you faxing
so early in the morning?

3
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:10,713
Kinda hard to explain.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,316
<i>I don't have a ton of contact
with the Scranton branch,</i>

5
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:17,630
but before I left, I took a box
of Dwight's stationery.

6
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:21,200
So from time to time,
I send Dwight faxes.

7
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,382
From himself.

8
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,638
From the future.

9
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:29,535
<i>"Dwight, "At 8:00 A.M. today,
someone poisons the coffee. <i/i>

10
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:33,270
<i>"Do not drink the coffee.
"More instructions will follow.</i>

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,223
<i>"Cordially, Future Dwight"</i>

12
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,990
Nooo!

13
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:45,723
You'll thank me later.

Episode 7
"Branch Closing"

15
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:13,641
The catch 22 team
Raceman

16
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,383
http://www.theofficeus.fr/
http://www.1000fr.com/

17
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:20,392
There she is.

18
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:22,673
- Jan Levinson. First thing in the morning.
- Michael.

19
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:26,540
I love to start my day
with a hearty bowl of Jan.

20
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:29,393
- Michael.
-"Just call me Levinson"

21
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:33,603
- "In the morning Baby"
- Michael.

22
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:34,843
Yes.

23
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:41,260
I'm here to tell you that we are
closing the Scranton branch.

24
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:44,801
I don't understand.

25
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,870
The board voted last
night to close your branch.

26
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:52,191
- On whom's authority?
- The board's.

27
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:57,790
- W-what?
- I'm very sorry. I-I...

28
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:01,463
I don't relish telling you this.

29
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:06,051
You've been a big part of this company.
And the board asked me to thank you

30
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:09,612
- for your years of service.
- You're welcome.

31
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:12,023
A small number of people will be
transferred to the Stamford branch,

32
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:14,880
and the rest will be
getting severance packages.

33
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,720
Am I a small number person
or a severance package person?

34
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:23,543
Well, we haven't made final
decisions about personnel yet.

35
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:28,670
- But you're a severance package person.
- Oh, no.

36
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,513
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

37
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:37,060
- <i>I don't really get it.</i>
Because we're not doing that bad,

38
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,413
and our numbers are gonna come up.

39
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:39,943
Yeah, but it's not all
about numbers, Michael.

40
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:41,253
- Well
- It's, it's about talent.

41
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:43,610
Oh, you gotta-- Josh?

42
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:47,432
Our CFO believes that Josh is going
to play an important role-Josh.

43
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,493
- in our company's future.
- Really? What role is that?

44
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:51,890
- Yes, really.
- King of the stupid universe?

45
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,350
It is an outrage.

46
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,310
That's all.
It's...

47
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:00,321
They're making a huge, huge mistake.

48
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,231
Let's see Josh replace these people.

49
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,751
Let's see Josh find another Stanley.

50
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:10,222
You think Stanleys grow on trees?
Well, they don't.

51
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:12,533
<i>There is no Stanley tree.</i>

52
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:16,270
<i>Do you think the world is
crawling with Phyllises?</i>

53
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,351
Show me that farm.

54
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:22,121
With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up

55
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:24,680
all over the place,
ripe for the plucking.

56
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,540
Show me that farm.

57
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:34,833
Pictures.
Memories.

58
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:38,791
Look at that.
They grow up so fast.

59
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:43,740
- Hey, stranger.
- Don't say that.

60
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:45,260
That just sounds weird. Please.

61
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:47,750
Sorry, I just feel like we
haven't talked in a while.

62
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:50,431
Well, we have nothing
to talk about, Dwight.

63
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:52,510
Just do your work.

64
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,222
While you still can.

65
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,390
<i>When you become close with someone,
you develop a kind of sixth sense.</i>

66
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:00,692
<i>You can read their
moods like a book.<:I>

67
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:03,420
Right now, the title
of Michael's book is

68
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,400
Something Weird Is Going On.

69
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:10,560
Colon: What Did Jan Say?

70
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,923
The Michael Scott Story.

71
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:18,873
By Michael Scott.
With Dwight Schrute.

72
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:22,861
Hey, did you hear about
your friends in Pennsylvania?

73
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:26,602
Really

74
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:28,530
Wow, that's too bad.

75
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:32,740
Sorry. Scranton branch is closing?

76
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:35,873
In your face.

77
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:38,320
Well, I work here now.

78
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,931
Sucka!

79
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,681
- Are you okay?
-Yeah. Great, amazing.

80
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:52,130
Best physical condition of my life.

81
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:55,313
- What did Jan want?
- Nothing. Just checking in.

82
00:04:57,816 --> 00:04:59,823
I can't tell you, so.

83
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:03,193
- What can't you tell me?
- Nothing. Pam.

84
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,961
What difference does it make?
We'll all be gone in a few weeks anyway.

85
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:07,501
- What?
-What?

86
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,662
- You just said that we're gonna be gone
- Do I have any messages?

87
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:12,163
-  Michael, what's going on?
- Okay.

88
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:16,300
Listen up, everybody.
I have some news.

89
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:20,940
We are screwed.

90
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:23,392
Dunder-Mifflin Scranton
is being shut down.

91
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:26,542
Michael, We shouldn't
be talking about this

92
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:29,783
until all the decisions have been made.

93
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,940
You knew about this
all along, didn't you?

94
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,942
Jan told me just a few
minutes before she told you.

95
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,141
Traitor.
You are a traitor.

96
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,370
What about us, Michael?
Do we still have jobs?

97
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:43,120
I don't know.
Probably not.

98
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,470
This is the worst.

99
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:53,221
It makes perfect sense
that it would happen today

100
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:56,132
because I just received
this in the mail.

101
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:59,473
1,000 business cards with this
address and phone number.

102
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:02,872
I don't want to blame
anyone in particular.

103
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:04,971
I think everyone's to blame.

104
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,801
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off,

105
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,060
I will kill myself.

106
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:13,903
Like Romeo and Juliet.
The Claire Danes one.

107
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,973
<i>Stamford Connecticut</i>

108
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,881
<i>Stamford Connecticut</i>

109
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:22,031
I worked in Scranton
for a really long time. And...

110
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,723
It's  gonna be weird
that it's all disappearing.

111
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,510
I mean, I always knew that the branch
would shut down someday.

112
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:30,412
I just figured it would
be because Michael...

113
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:33,170
sold the building for some magic beans. 

114
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,003
<i>I couldn't be happier.</i>

115
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:40,833
I'm gonna take the
severance and retire.

116
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:42,942
My wife and I are gonna travel.

117
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:45,491
I really couldn't be happier.

118
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:47,670
It's a blessing in disguise.

119
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:50,251
Actually, not even in disguise.

120
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:54,190
Sometimes at home, I answer the phone,
"Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam."

121
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:57,340
So...maybe that'll stop now.

122
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,800
What does that mean?

123
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:01,613
Well,  some of us are fired,

124
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,640
and a few are going to Connecticut.

125
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:06,173
I don't know if I really
wanna work here without Pam.

126
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,543
You know that Cinderella song?

127
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,993
You Don't Know What
You Got Till It's Gone?

128
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,110
That pretty much says
it better than how I know

129
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,291
how to say it in words.

130
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,882
Hey, Mike.
Darrel. Noble Darrel.

131
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,051
Look, I heard about the office.

132
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:31,883
- tuff break???
- I know. I know

133
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,390
Well, I'll land on my feet.

134
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,472
- Yeah. Don't worry about me.
- I wasn't.

135
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:39,572
So you'll be okay too.
You're warrior, you're smart.

136
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:42,352
Capable. You'll find
something else, and...

137
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,822
Actually, Bob Vance
bought out the warehouse.

138
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:48,223
- So he's keeping on the whole crew.
- So we're good.

139
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,121
Awesome.

140
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:53,033
This is my house.

141
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,860
The CFO's taking away
my house and giving it to Josh.

142
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:59,081
And Josh is giving the
garage to Bob Vance.

143
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,950
All right, listen up.

144
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:09,793
Some of you may have heard some
rumors about the branch closing.

145
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,760
But I am not going
to take this lying down.

146
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:16,083
I have a plan,
and I am going to save our jobs.

147
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:17,903
So just hang in there. Let's go.

148
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:20,213
- Yes!
- Oh, good. You're bringing Dwight.

149
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,750
Yes. This might get ugly.
I'm gonna need backup.

150
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,750
-What's the plan?
- Go to New York.

151
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:30,402
Confront the CFO. Show him he's
making a mistake. Save the branch.

152
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,161
Can I drive? No way.

153
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:34,391
- Shotgun!
- No, there's no one else.

154
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,303
Still.

155
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:41,100
Thank you very much.
Okay.

156
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,291
Secretary says Wallace
is away for the day.

157
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,292
and won't be coming
back into the office.

158
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:46,483
Okay.

159
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,212
But... Do not worry.

160
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:52,612
I have his home address...
Right here.

161
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,861
- Why?
- Christmas card list.

162
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:58,531
You send him cards?
You've never met him.

163
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:01,061
Well, when I do,
we'll have something to talk about.

164
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:06,432
Hey, do you have a second?
Sure, what's up?

165
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:09,071
I know it's not definite,
or whatever, but

166
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:12,340
but, uh, do you know who's
coming over here from Scranton?

167
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,113
I honestly don't. I don't know.

168
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,000
So is it, like, sales or
accountants?

169
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,230
You know what, Jim?
I wouldn't worry about it.

170
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,123
What does that mean?

171
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,500
- Hi.
- Come in, hey.

172
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,350
Oh, good, you're both here.

173
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:26,490
Ready to talk logistics?

174
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:30,060
I just feel like it could
have been something special

175
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:32,582
if we could have kept working together.
But...

176
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,781
I'm gonna go someplace else,
and you're gonna go someplace else.

177
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:39,590
It just doesn't make sense.

178
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,850
This kind of worked
out perfectly for me.

179
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:43,780
I got some good experience.

180
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:46,900
Michael's gonna write me
a great recommendation.

181
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,730
And as far as me and Kelly goes...

182
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:53,093
I think it's for the best.

183
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:54,270
Okay.

184
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:56,033
This is it.

185
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:59,191
This is exactly what Michael Moore does.

186
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,122
Famous documentarian.

187
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,662
He goes up to people with a camera,

188
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,153
and he's like,
"Why did you do this?

189
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:09,102
"Why did you pollute?
"You are bad. You're a bad person."

190
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:12,281
Very dramatic.
Although I can't say I was a big fan

191
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:15,221
of Bowling For Columbine.
Because I thought it was gonna be

192
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,793
a bowling movie.
Like Kingpin.

193
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:24,931
And it wasn't. It was something else.

194
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:28,531
So.

195
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,500
Josh will be running what is now called
Dunder-Mifflin Northeast,

196
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:34,501
which is all the
offices north of Stamford.

197
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:37,050
And Jim, if you want the job,
you'll be his number two.

198
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:39,801
Wow. sure. Absolutely.

199
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,951
Awesome. 'Scuse me, Jan. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to stop you there.

200
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,592
I...

201
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:46,271
will not be taking the job.

202
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:48,813
Excu--why not?

203
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:52,761
As of today, I have accepted a
senior management position at Staples.

204
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:55,433
Today.

205
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:59,661
You leveraged your new
position with us into another offer?

206
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,393
Damn it, Josh.

207
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,841
This whole restructuring thing
was based around keeping you.

208
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:07,923
I'm sorry, all right? It's done.

209
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:10,180
It's time.
I gotta make some calls.

210
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:12,383
Excuse me. I'm sorry, Jim.

211
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:16,970
Say what you will
about Michael Scott.

212
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:19,130
But he would never do that.

213
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:22,961
So.

214
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,942
Do you know what you're gonna say
when he shows up?

215
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:26,313
I will improvise.

216
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,561
- I will speak from the heart.
- No. Bad idea.

217
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:30,610
You need an attack plan.

218
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:32,600
Here, I'll be him. You be you.

219
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,651
- Let's practice.
- All right.

220
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:38,460
- Coming home from work.
- 'Scuse me.

221
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:40,141
- Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
- Yes.

222
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:41,532
What is the meaning of this?

223
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:45,102
Can you tell us why you
are shutting down Scranton

224
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,472
and putting 15 people out of work?

225
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:50,170
Well, the branch is
no longer financially viable.

226
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:51,381
It's simple dollars and cents.

227
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:53,891
Yes,  but these are employees, sir.

228
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:55,992
- These are human beings.
- Listen, Scott.

229
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,873
We're losing money, okay?

230
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,292
It's not a charity.
It's a business.

231
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,832
- And it's a dying business.
- Stop--stop it. Just...

232
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,072
- Okay, he's not gonna say any of that.
- It-- Wh--hey, why not?

233
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,710
Because he'd be
intimidated. And I just--

234
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:09,462
- Let's start again.
- Just be more scared of me, okay? Okay.

235
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:11,101
Don't touch me this time.

236
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:12,852
<i> Dum dee do dee do dee doe</i>

237
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:14,703
- Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
- Coming home from w-- Agh!

238
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:25,762
So we are still
scrambling here, but,

239
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:28,861
It looks like Scranton is
going to absorb Stamford.

240
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:30,333
Wow.

241
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:33,271
And I know that you just left there
couple of months ago,

242
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,631
but we would like to offer
you the number two position

243
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,312
- at that branch.
- Thank you.

244
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,662
No, it's just, I'm not sure if I...

245
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:43,132
Well, to be quite honest with you, Jan,

246
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,801
I have a few unpleasant
memories of Scranton.

247
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,140
- Michael.
- No, no, no.

248
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,832
Just,some personal stuff.

249
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,230
And I'm not really
ready to revisit that,

250
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:56,511
I don't think.

251
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:00,531
Well. Please think about it.

252
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,813
And call me.

253
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:04,060
We will do whatever we
can to get you to stay.

254
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:05,103
Okay.

255
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,350
Hey, guys.

256
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,122
I'm trying to organize a little group
lunch for everybody, since, you know,

257
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,511
we're never gonna see each other again.

258
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,840
Where are we going?
I thought maybe DJ's?

259
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,201
How 'bout Cugino's?

260
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:22,713
I don't wanna go all
the way to Dunmore.

261
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:24,923
How 'bout Cooper's, then?

262
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,430
No seafood.

263
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:29,110
Well, I don't want to go to DJ's.

264
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,840
Oh, now, all of a sudden, you get picky?

265
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,691
Okay. Forget it.

266
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,151
Hooters.

267
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,461
No.

268
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:40,991
Ah! Here.

269
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,282
Replenish your fluids.

270
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:53,012
Where's Michael?

271
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:54,503
He's not here.

272
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:56,512
I don't know where he is.

273
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,181
What...

274
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:01,730
What's going on here?

275
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:05,120
We know the branch is closing.
Michael told us.

276
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:07,472
Oh, God.

277
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,632
Okay. You know what, everybody?

278
00:14:09,735 --> 00:14:11,071
I'm sure there is
a better way to do this,

279
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,682
but I've driven something like 400 miles
today, and I'm completely exhausted.

280
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,703
So I'm just gonna tell you.
Your branch is not closing.

281
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:20,241
Stamford is closing 
for the time being, it seems

282
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:21,860
that all of your jobs are safe.

283
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:23,673
Yes.

284
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:26,020
Stanley.

285
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,461
Is it because of Michael?

286
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,330
Did he actually do something?

287
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,812
Well, reasons are not important.

288
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:33,642
Would you just call him,
please, wherever he is,

289
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,812
- And tell him?
- Sure. Jan.

290
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:38,071
Do  you know--is anyone
coming back to Scranton?

291
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:39,171
Back?

292
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:40,322
Coming to Scranton.

293
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:41,371
Is anyone coming to Scranton?

294
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:44,493
- We don't know.
- Probably a few.

295
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,072
- Who is it?
- The office.

296
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,433
Are you gonna get it? No.

297
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:58,771
Not until I have some
good news for them.

298
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,693
Not until I have some good news.

299
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:06,323
I guess new people might
be coming from Stamford.

300
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,940
Should be fun. New blood.

301
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:12,020
Is Jim coming back?
That's,

302
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:14,881
I hadn't thought about it.
I don't know.

303
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:17,193
I just don't want it to be weird.

304
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:19,433
You know?

305
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:21,633
I mean, I took his old job

306
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,962
- And his old desk.
- Yeah, yeah, that might be weird.

307
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,563
Overall, though,

308
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:30,172
we still all have our jobs,
so good news, right?

309
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:33,811
- Oh, yeah. Totally.
- I'm so happy!

310
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:36,310
We don't have to break up now, Ryan!

311
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:39,343
It is the best day of my whole life.

312
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,393
- What are you gonna do?
- I really don't know.

313
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:51,032
- How you doing with all this?
- You know, I'm fine.

314
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,222
I'll be better when
I know if I have a job.

315
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:56,593
You'd actually move to Scranton?

316
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:59,203
Yeah, if they let me.
I think I-- I think I would.

317
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:02,382
New York City is 45 minutes
down the road from here.

318
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:04,970
And you wanna move to Scranton.

319
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:08,102
If I were you, I'd move to New York.

320
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,762
Yeah, you know, I-- I might do that.

321
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm who knows?
I might do that.

322
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:28,190
- Hey Andy!
- What's up Josh ?

323
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:30,410
Hey, man, just wanted to say thanks.
Good luck.

324
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:33,011
- Thanks, man. You, too.
- Totally.

325
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,450
- Anything?
- Nothing.

326
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,633
What if this doesn't work?

327
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:44,433
What if the office actually goes under?

328
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,153
Then it was an honor
to have worked with you.

329
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:00,940
All right.

330
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:05,303
Favorite moments
in Dunder-Mifflin history.

331
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:06,962
Go.

332
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:10,132
My first day, when you hazed me

333
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:13,730
by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.

334
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:17,981
That was hilarious.
The foam.

335
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:24,003
My first sale.My promotion to
assistant regional manager.

336
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:26,852
Our basketball game.

337
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:33,473
And when you took me to the hospital...
and told me that you cared about me.

338
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,141
- Oh, right. Okay.
- That's enough. That's good.

339
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:42,230
What were your favorite moments?

340
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:48,330
All of 'em. I loved 'em all.
Every single one.

341
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,621
What about when Jan
said the branch was closing?

342
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:55,533
- God, Dwight.
- Well, I just...

343
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,623
Hey, Pam.
We're going to Poor Richard's.

344
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:02,153
- Creed's buying shots.
- No, thanks, guys.

345
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:03,762
- All right. 
- Have fun, though.

346
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,463
- Cool.
- Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.

347
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,223
Really? Where did you hear that?

348
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:09,613
- Ryan, are you coming ?
- Well, I was.

349
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,692
Yeah, we'll meet you there.
Awesome.

350
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:13,862
- Let's go.
- I'll tell you later.

351
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:16,592
- Okay.
- Hi.

352
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:21,640
- Crazy day, huh?
- Yeah.

353
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,761
- Yeah.
- Man.

354
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,183
I'm...

355
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,913
I'm really glad you're
still gonna be working here.

356
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:33,461
Yeah, me, too.
Maybe this is good.

357
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,113
Finding another job is a pain.

358
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:39,783
There's another annoying boss,
another desk.

359
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:42,480
<i>I'd have to learn
everything all over again.</i>

360
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,232
<i>So...</i>

361
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,761
there are reasons to stay.

362
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:52,053
Hey...
I think I am gonna take that job.

363
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,752
And Scranton?

364
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:57,753
It's not that bad.
So...

365
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,380
If they offer you a job there... 

366
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:04,103
I think you should take it.

367
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,530
- Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
- Okay.

368
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:09,312
Yeah, I'm happy he said that.

369
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:12,411
I mean, I don't think he's
into me or anything. But...

370
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:15,412
I'm kind of into him.

371
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,100
So...there you go.

372
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:27,322
What are we still doing here?

373
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,331
It's  over.

374
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:33,452
Let's go home.
Get the car.

375
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:41,810
This was such a stupid idea.
This was so stupid.

376
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:45,460
I'm such a stupid idiot.

377
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:47,812
I let everybody down.

378
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,140
Everybody hates me.

379
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,920
I lost everybody's jobs.

380
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:55,823
- Nobody likes me anymore!
- Oh, my God!

381
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,461
- What?
- Stamford is closed!

382
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:02,343
Michael, we're not closed.
Stamford is closed!

383
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,243
- Stamford is closed! We did it.
- We did it?

384
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:07,372
- We did it!
- We did it!

385
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:13,152
- We did it!
- Yeah!

386
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:16,270
Yeah! Right here, right here.

387
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,382
- Yeah, baby!
- In your face!

388
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:26,231
- We did it.
- Oh, man.

389
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:29,621
- How did we do it?
- I don't know. I have no idea.

390
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:31,651
I don't understand.
