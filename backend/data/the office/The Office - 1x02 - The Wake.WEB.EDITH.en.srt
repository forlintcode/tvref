00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,640
[Lizzie] Artificial intelligence
is changing the business landscape.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,040
As productivity manager, I have invested
in a high tech, cutting edge AI product

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,480
that will save us thousands.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,400
Unlike humans,
our AI bots don't question authority,

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,480
need the toilet, or have emotions.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,680
So yes...

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,720
I am firing the cleaners.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
[title music plays]

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,360
But listen, if you can up it by 200,
I'll throw in a pallet of 48 mils

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,880
-and some dividers at no additional cost.
-[lift dings]

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,040
[man] Things change. Circumstances change.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,000
Right now, their sick,
we've got to get moving.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,600
Mason, your sick nan isn't a reason
to rush in and have a baby.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,640
[Mason] I don't get it, babe.
This is what you wanted.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,400
[Greta] What I want is maybe to
do all the things I haven't done yet.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,000
Like going to Santorini,
or getting a back tattoo,

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,360
or taking LSD. You know, I haven't.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,120
I haven't been in a threesome.
I haven't been skydiving.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,760
-And what about my work?
-[Mason] Okay, I love you.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,600
I want what you want.
So let's just keep talking yeah?

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,000
[Greta] Yeah, later. Time and place.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
[Alisha] I don't like your chances
of saving the office

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,080
with these numbers Hannah.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,720
[Hannah] They are looking good.
Sales are steady Eddie.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,720
Making cuts all over the place.
Snippety-snip.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,880
Really? How so?

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
Turning off lights,
not cranking the old air-con...

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,920
-And layoffs of course
-You've made redundancies?

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,000
We are getting rid of two cleaners today.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,920
Yeah, I don't think laying off
your part time cleaners

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,560
is going to help you meet
your targets Hannah.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,880
Yeah, I agree,
and that is why I have...

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,800
fired Brian.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,320
-Brian.
-Yep.

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Brian last week laid him off.
Laid him right off.

37
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,400
-Brian is from warehouse accounts.
-[Hannah] Yep.

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,680
He sat over there.

39
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,680
So why?

40
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,720
He just sort of come
to the end of the road.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,320
Wasn't doing his job.
Often tardy, just dead weight.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,040
We're going to go down to the warehouse.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,440
Make sure their accounting
needs are taken care of.

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,160
Ah, do you know? We've got it covered?
Deb's taking care of all accounts now.

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
-Yeah, but still, I mean, it's--
-Yeah, no, we'd better go down,

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,880
Have a little girls trip! Yeah.
-After you.

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,079
[vacuum bot hums]
-[Hannah] Um Lizzie,

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,600
We're just going to head down
to the warehouse, Alisha and I,

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
because I fired Brian last week.

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
-Wha-- Brian?
-Yeah.

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,680
So maybe you can give Stevie a call,
tell him that we're heading down...

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,120
to talk to him because I fired Brian,
I fired him.

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
[Hannah] Thanks, Lizzie.

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,480
[Lizzie] Brian died last Wednesday.

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,600
3:34 a.m. Cardiac arrest.

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,400
[Hannah] Ah, okay.
Oh, God. It's all happening down here.

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,960
You know what? We can come back.

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,160
-[Stevie] No. You're right, I can talk.
-[Hannah] Yep.

59
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,200
[Alisha] Oh, great.
I wanted to check in re Brian,

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,240
make sure
your accountancy needs taken care of.

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,640
Yeah, we're all good.
Deb said you could sort something, so...

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,000
Just like I said. So we can…

63
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,280
-Such a shame. He's such a nice guy.

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,120
-Yeah, look, redundancies are hard--
-Well said. Let's go.

65
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,760
Brian wasn't made redundant.
He passed away.

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,280
-What?
-What?

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Oh, my God, he must have taken it
so badly when I fired him.

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,320
You said that he'd come
to the end of the road.

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,400
Yeah, I did, God,
I suppose it was two roads, wasn't it?

70
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,720
At the same time.

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,000
Like, what are the chances,
like getting fired and dying same day?

72
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,360
You know what?

73
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
Minute's silence for Brian?

74
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,040
[Hannah sniffs]
-Sorry about this Stevie.

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,480
[whispers] Is she gone?

76
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,440
[vacuum bot hums]

77
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,840
[Deb] I can't pick him up from judo.

78
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,240
Fuck off.

79
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,560
No, no. Not you. They've got this...

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,240
You know those
robot vacuum cleaner things?

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
[Lizzie] Mason, can you please sign in?

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
Well, then I shall have to do it
for you, again.

83
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,960
Hey. What's up?

84
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
[Mason] I was just feeling bad
about our conversation.

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,760
I've been thinking about what you said.
And you're right.

86
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,040
You're completely right.
You know, I, of course

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,880
I want you to feel like you've lived
a full life before becoming a mum.

88
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,200
So...

89
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,400
I'm happy for you to bring in
a friend of your choice.

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Sorry. What?

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Yes.

92
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,839
[gleefully]
I'm giving you your threesome.

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,360
That's what you took
from our conversation?

94
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,200
Yeah. Babe. I don't want
you to have any regrets.

95
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,760
[Mason] Listen, start thinking about who
you want to bring in,

96
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,440
because it's your treat.
It's your call. All right?

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,720
I love you.

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,159
I love you, too.

99
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,760
[Mason giggles] You're in shock.
Who doesn't listen now, huh?

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,520
[Alisha] And so I trust
that the mental health

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,000
of your staff has been taken care of.

102
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,280
Oh, I've created a culture
of resilience here so--

103
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,280
[Martin] I'll be conducting
a grief counselling session today

104
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,880
for those who wish to attend.

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,960
-That's great. Thank you Martin.
-Yeah.

106
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,640
It's really good to know
that everyone's in your safe hands.

107
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
-No worries.
[Hannah] Yeah, it's so good.

108
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,200
And I, to add to that springboard,
I'm going to throw... a wake.

109
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,280
[Hannah] Yeah, that's what families do.
And we're a Flinley Craddick family.

110
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,240
-And this wake's happening today?
-Yeah.

111
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,360
[Alisha] Okay.
Well obviously I would love to attend.

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,800
-Huh? It's it's very last minute.
-What time is it happening?

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,240
It's loose.

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,240
Uhm… I'--

115
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,040
I'll check with Lizzie,
but I think we said 2:00 p.m. Yeah.

116
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
The grief counselling is
running from 1 to 3--

117
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,440
3:00 p.m… It's 3:00 p.m... Yeah,
I got it mixed up.

118
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,160
Okay, 3:00 p.m.
I will see you all at 3:00 p.m.

119
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,760
-Can't wait.
-Thank you Martin.

120
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,120
-Martin. All good.
-Thank you. Hannah.

121
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,360
[Hannah] Thank you Alicia.
Thank you for your support today.

122
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,600
[door closes]

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
So we're throwing a wake now.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,760
Yeah, I always was... Martin.

125
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,440
United front yeah?

126
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,560
Hey guys, I just want to have
a moment of your time.

127
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,200
As you know,
we lost one of our own last week,

128
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,400
-Brian… Hodge.
-Hodge.

129
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, that's Brian Hodge.

130
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,520
Which one was Brian?

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Ah, he was the one who sat next to...

132
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
-[Josh] Josh.
-[Hannah] Josh. Thank you.

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,160
And Josh is just...

134
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,360
-Me.
-Yeah, I know, obviously.

135
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
-He worked from home mostly.
-[Hannah mutters in agreement]

136
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,440
And was retired,
but, recently, he unretired.

137
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,480
Probably should have stayed retired.

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,360
[Martin] And I'll be in the meeting room
from about one o' clock,

139
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,920
for anyone who wants to come through
and process anything for grief counselling

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
just to get some support
or just talk things through.

141
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,840
[Hannah] Or in less depressing news,

142
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,760
I'll be celebrating Brian's life
at 3:00p.m. with a wake.

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,680
And I know he'd want you all
to be there because we were so close.

144
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,360
I just can't picture him.

145
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,520
I can. 'Cause he's always in my heart.

146
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,520
What he look like?

147
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
What did he look like?
It's hard to put into words.

148
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,240
-You made him a cup of tea last week.
-Did I?

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,520
-Oh, is he the tall, sad one?
-Yeah.

150
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,080
[Tina]
No, he was the short and smiley one.

151
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,120
-Yeah, that's what I meant.
-[Nick] What nationality is he.

152
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,120
Err, What sexual identity is he?

153
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,760
-Doesn't feel relevant does it?
-What did his voice sound like?

154
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,600
[Hannah] His voice?
[deep voice] I'm Bryan Hodge,

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,159
and I sit next to...

156
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,280
-Jack. Josh.
-Josh.

157
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,440
[Lizzie] I can send you a copy
of his driver's license

158
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,640
-if you need a visual ID.
-I don't need it.

159
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
-I don't need his license.
-Yeah.

160
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,440
But send it to me so I can sign off on it.

161
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,400
Sign off
on the late Brian's driver's license.

162
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,080
Yeah. So then I can distribute it...

163
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
to people
who don't remember what he looks like.

164
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,520
Could I please be on that email?

165
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,160
You're the only person
who's on that email, Lloyd. Yeah.

166
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,720
[Martin] There are some bosses
who respect the grieving process,

167
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,480
and there are some who throw an impromptu
wake for a dead staff member,

168
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,080
they can't remember,
just to prove a point.

169
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,200
Right. As you know, I love a party
and I know how to throw one.

170
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
But because I've got to focus
on my death speech.

171
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
-Eulogy.
-Yep.

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I've decided to put together
a party planning committee.

173
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,360
And congratulations. You're it.

174
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,240
Why us?

175
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,640
Why not you?
So let's think headlines, bullet points.

176
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,200
What I'm thinking is it's got
to be moving, emotional and also "fun".

177
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Quite the vibe.

178
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,560
They're all quite different vibes.

179
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,560
Yes, but why don't you think
about Four Weddings and a funeral?

180
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,600
It's got romance, comedy,
weddings, funeral, gay people.

181
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,720
So let's give Brian the send off
with all the things he loves the most.

182
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400
I don't want to be on the party committee.

183
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,840
I understand that, but you're also the
oldest and closest to the end,

184
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,760
so I would
really love your buy in on this event.

185
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,120
Okay? Come on, guys!
I want you to be in charge of things.

186
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Music, slideshow, decorations, food.

187
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,520
Yeah, it's a, it's a wake,
but I want people to feel a-wake.

188
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,400
[chuckles]
I want them to feel a-live.

189
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,640
At this point, I wish I was Brian.

190
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,360
I wish I could help out,
but obviously I'm not cool enough

191
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
to be on the party planning committee.

192
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,080
Remind me,
what's the criteria to be on it?

193
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,320
Is it, saddest life,
[phone dings]

194
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,600
...connections in the balloon industry?
[phone dings again]

195
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,559
[Greta] Oh, my--

196
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,400
-Have you found a third person yet?
-What?

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,960
No. I'm not-- No.

198
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,840
[Greta] Mason started sending through
options.

199
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,000
Nick Fletcher, Flinley Craddick

200
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,120
Oh. That's Claudia. She's our dentist.

201
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,880
[mouse clicks]

202
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,280
Hey Deb?

203
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,280
How do you make one photo melt
into another photo.

204
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,400
Melt?

205
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,640
You know, like when a photo bleeds into
another one

206
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,240
to create a kind of emotional...

207
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,280
Never mind.

208
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
-[papers rustle]
-[Lizzie] Lloyd.

209
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,640
-Deb.
-What's this?

210
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,040
The cleaning roster for the toilets.

211
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,440
I'm firing the cleaners,
so... we all need to chip in.

212
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,320
Umm, Lizzie, I see that you've rostered me
on for three afternoons in a row.

213
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,480
Can we even get out
with a couple of morning shifts

214
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
-before people have had lunch?
-No.

215
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,480
This will be enforced, Deb.

216
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,440
Or you’ll
soon find that they...

217
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,200
Will be doing your job too.

218
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,640
Hello, everyone. Hmm, Sadder.

219
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,320
[voice cracks] Hello, everyone.

220
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,760
-[Hannah voice cracking] Hello, Lizzie.
-Have you had a stroke?

221
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,400
No. I'm practising my feelings.

222
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,680
And the cleaning rosters
have been circulated.

223
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,320
Oh. Have you fired the cleaners then?

224
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,560
No, I'm just about to send them a text
and then block their number.

225
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,520
Okay. Don't.

226
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,920
I need a full house.

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
Let's invite them to the wake,
and then we can fire them after.

228
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
Nice.

229
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,880
Actually, it might be a good opportunity
for Alisha to see my ruthless side.

230
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,520
But-- but that's my job.

231
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm bad cop.

232
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,760
Well, I'm chief of bad cops,
so this what's happenin'.

233
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,680
I really need this.

234
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,120
It's really ugly when you beg.
Don't do that.

235
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,680
[water cooler bubbles]

236
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,640
Oh, hi.
Um… My wife Kelly might be up for it.

237
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,440
-Sorry. What?
-You know, you're three way.

238
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,360
To be honest you'd be doing me a favour.

239
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
Since menopause,
I'm dead from the neck down.

240
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,880
[awkwardly] Oh, okay. Um...

241
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,880
Use it before you lose it.

242
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
[Sebastian] Yeah, it turns out Brian
ordered Mexican almost every single day.

243
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,000
He's a big fan of the chips
and cheesy pork tacos.

244
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
It's possibly what killed him.

245
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,960
[Hannah]
You know, Brian retired then unretired

246
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,880
and some people might say
it was because of the cost of living

247
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,880
and the pension not being liveable.

248
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,200
But for me, I think it's that he had to be
here in the office,

249
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,640
-[phone dings]
-...that he loved it.

250
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,960
-[Greta] Ugh!
-[Hannah] And my speech needs to...

251
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
honour his legacy.

252
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
[muffled] Brian was a man...

253
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,520
[Hannah] If I can't save this office,
then Brian died for nothing.

254
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,480
[loudly]
It's good. Needs a few more LOL's.

255
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
[Hannah] I have a dream.

256
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,840
[excitedly]
I have a team! I had a team.

257
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,560
[keyboard clacks]

258
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,520
Um...excuse me? We've got--

259
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
-Lizzie.
-Yeah.

260
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,400
[Hannah whispers] Come here.

261
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,880
Don't let the delivery drivers leave
because we want to keep the numbers up.

262
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,320
-Roger that.
-For the wakety wake.

263
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
Hey, I've also written your script.

264
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,360
Oh, no. I finished my speech.

265
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,960
-It's actually really good.
-No, no.

266
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,200
Your script for firing the cleaners.

267
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,840
You need to give them
specific reasons for their dismissal.

268
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,120
Hunchbacks. Too old…

269
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,680
-Poor English skills?
-Mm-hmm.

270
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,840
I can't say that.

271
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,320
You can't? Or you won't?

272
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,320
Both.

273
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,560
And I'm actually really good
at firing people, so I don't need it.

274
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,040
Okay, well, if you need back up...

275
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,360
-We're here.
-[vacuum bots hum]

276
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,360
Yep I don't.

277
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Umm...

278
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,520
-I'm sure you've heard all about the...
-About what?

279
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,080
Oh, the…Mason...

280
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,400
What are you talking about?

281
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,840
[Hannah] Hey, Greta, you know what?

282
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,560
I was thinking a really, like,
respectful way to open the wake

283
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,040
would be if you did a Welcome to Country?

284
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
Oh. Umm, Yeah. No.

285
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,720
-Me?
-[Hannah quietly] Yeah.

286
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,160
Umm...I'll get back to you on that.

287
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,200
This is why progress is so hard.

288
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,480
[footsteps recede]

289
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,760
[both chuckle]

290
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,040
-I'll see you later.
-[Greta] See ya.

291
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,360
-Ow! There's a wall there.
-[Greta chuckles]

292
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,840
-[Nick] Watch out for that.
-Thank you.

293
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,120
Sorry, no one turned up.

294
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,280
[sympathetically]
Oh, God.

295
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,640
Brian.
He just loved Mexican food, didn't he?

296
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,760
-Um, I don't really--
-Yeah, we don't really know him

297
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,920
Yeah. So I was thinking maybe you guys
could stick around,

298
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,120
say a few words at the top of the wake.

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Maybe, you know, like a warm up act,
maybe a Mexican wave.

300
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,120
Well, I'm Turkish German so I don't know--

301
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,240
-[lift dings]
- [Hannah] Yeah, That makes sense.

302
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,720
-Yeah, we probably gotta--
-'Scuse me. [Hannah mumbles]

303
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,680
[delivery man]…Just go.

304
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,960
Alisha.

305
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

306
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,760
Would have meant a lot
to Brian that you're here.

307
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,360
Come take a seat. We're about to begin.

308
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,000
These are the Lopez brothers.

309
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,400
The delivery peop--
-[Hannah] Do something with them.

310
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,720
And we've got a seat for you
down the front.

311
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,160
Um, everyone. Could we-- Oh.
[high pitched feedback]

312
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,320
Oh, Lloyd, can you fix this?

313
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,160
Can everyone just gather around?
Because we're about to begin.

314
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
Hello? Hello.

315
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,000
-[feedback continues and echoes]
-[Hannah] Worse.

316
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,520
It's on lead guitar setting.

317
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,320
Okay. Can you make it not on that?

318
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,480
Before we kick off,
I'd just like to thank you--

319
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,920
-[vacuum bot hums]
-Lizzie. Can we...

320
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,600
-[Lizzie] Yep.
-…stop these immediately, please?

321
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,880
I'd like to thank Alisha
for coming down to support the local

322
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,280
Rydalmere Flinley Craddick family.

323
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Also, I'd like to kick it off with two
very special guests who knew Brian

324
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
almost as well as any of us.

325
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,760
The local delivery guys from
Lopez y Lopez.

326
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
[polite clapping]

327
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,360
[Hannah] Come on down.
Say a few words. Yeah?

328
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,280
-This ought to be good.
-Mm-hmm.

329
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,080
Brian was a loyal customer, um...

330
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,760
He he always used the app to pay,
and he left good reviews.

331

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,880
-[Greta] What are you doing here?
-[Mason] Did you get the pics?

341

-[Mason] I'm leaning towards the dentist.

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
[Hannah] What to say about Brian?

343
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,760
Um, he was short, but that smile, ooh boy!
Could light up a room.

344
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,480
Am I right, Tina?
Born on the 13th of July, 1957.

345
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,800
He was a giver, a donor,
some might say of organs.

348
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:57,000
[Hannah] Brian enjoyed driving.
All sorts of vehicles, cars, mopeds

349
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
and other learner approved motorcycles.

350
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,160
But the truth is,
we had the privilege of knowing Brian

351
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,680
because he had the opportunity
to come to work,

352
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,200
to this beautiful office.

353
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,520
I actually made him a cup of tea
last week, apparently.

354
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,280
Well said.

355
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,120
And now to think of a future without
this office, without our community.

356
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,680
I think this office gave Brian a purpose
and a reason to get up in the morning.

357
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,320
A reason for him to do his hair and...

358
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,920
put on his heels and his lipstick.

359
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,320
