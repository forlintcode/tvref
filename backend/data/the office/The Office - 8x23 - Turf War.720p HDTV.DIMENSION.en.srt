1
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:04,890
Man.

2
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:06,548
My delts are blasted.

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,839
I wish they had a chart
for how much protein powder to scoop.

4
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:15,098
- For a 180 pound man with no fat.
- Protein powder.

5
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:19,386
You cut it with water?
Why don't you just take estrogen?

6
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:28,765
There you go, boys.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,989
See how papa takes care of you?

8
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:35,340
I remember when people
thought biceps were all that.

9
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:37,120
They'd flex them at the discotheque.

10
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:40,321
I bet you think it's all about core.

11
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:42,175
- Please.
- Core's critical.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,992
There are four tenets of pilates
that I live my life by.

13
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:46,546
One: lengthen.

14
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:48,479
Two: elongate.

15
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:50,662
I think we all want
to know the same thing.

16
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:51,718
Who's stronger?

17
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,179
There's only one way to solve that.

18
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:56,684
Flat curl contest.

19
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:59,248
Here we go, everybody.

20
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:01,106
May the manliest man win.

21
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:02,062
Go.

22
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:07,018
Feast on this, Lewis.

23
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,029
- I love the burn.
- The burn is where I live.

24
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:13,131
Come on, Gabe,
you can't handle his hamstrings.

25
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:16,159
- You're getting hypno-thigh-zed.
- Speed set. One.

26
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,914
- Here, this is for your elbows.
- Thank you.

27
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:23,291
Five, six...

28
00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:25,669
Phone call from you.

29
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,963
Keep going.
Eight, nine, ten.

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,231
Ten.

31
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:31,695
We got it?

32
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,053
Very funny.

33
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,280
Yeah, Jim.

34
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:38,348
Way to mock us
for perfecting our bodies.

35
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,614
Everyone.
Conference room, now.

36
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:48,930
All right, easy there, grandpa.

37
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:50,792
I don't need your help.

38
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,141
- You don't need my help?
- Here. Just...

39
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:58,744
- Feygnasse Team -
.: La Fabrique :.

40
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:03,768
8x23: <i>Turf War</i>

41
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:06,543
Morning.

42
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,572
Somebody left
in such a hurry this morning

43
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,320
that she forgot...

44
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,384
These.

45
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:17,044
The only thing
more delicious than your feet

46
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:19,973
is the feast that I am going
to prepare for everyone.

47
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,939
If you're gonna hang out
for a while...

48
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:26,865
What's this?

49
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,094
This dumb rule Robert made.

50
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,401
He just wants visitors to sign in.

51
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,361
Is this an attempt to embarrass me?

52
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:35,594
No, of course not.

53
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,647
I think it's, like,
if we make an exception for you,

54
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:42,411
then we have to make
an exception for the water guy.

55
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:45,036
And then, where does it end?

56
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,209
Why is it when other people
spend time at the office,

57
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,013
they're rewarded for it,

58
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:52,402
and when I do it,
I am told it's a little much?

59
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:58,365
Is it because I'm not an employee?
Because that's what it feels like.

60
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:00,751
- Enjoy the alumni game.
- We have a deal?

61
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,426
Thanks so much, Earl.

62
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:04,893
Wow, simultaneous sale.

63
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,561
They said it couldn't be done.

64
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:09,231
Lot going on, guys.
What's happening?

65
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,526
Binghamton branch closed last night
and all their clients are for grabs.

66
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,342
That was a fine branch.

67
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,184
Things are really bad
under Robert California.

68
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:20,158
It's like a festival of poo.

69
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:21,345
Come on, language.

70
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,192
And we're not interested
in your sour grapes.

71
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:27,771
- Tell him where he can stick them.
- In the fridge.

72
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,084
The butt, in his butt.

73
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,372
Sorry, I can't focus on zingers.
There's too many potential clients.

74
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,196
You better watch yourselves.

75
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,883
The Syracuse branch can't be happy
you're taking New York clients.

76
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,027
Why did Binghamton close?

77
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,889
Can everyone just please...

78
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,858
I had a one-man
saturnalia last night.

79
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:09,166
In celebration of
the finalization of my divorce,

80
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:12,592
I got into a case of Australian reds.

81
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:16,506
And... How should I say this...
Columbian whites.

82
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:21,052
What is this about Binghamton?

83
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,811
The branch closed.

84
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:23,972
Forever.

85
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,143
Closing the Binghamton branch
never occurred to me before today.

86
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:32,265
Or, I guess, last night.

87
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:35,897
But <i>in vino veritas,</i> <i>as they say.</i>

88
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,614
I'm not gonna start
doubting my drunken self now.

89
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,541
I got your voicemail.

90
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,633
From last night.

91
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,097
Wonderful.

92
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:51,868
And the answer...

93
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,834
is yes, yes, yes, yes, and...

94
00:04:58,267 --> 00:04:59,268
never.

95
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:11,419
When's the last time
you lived so intensely

96
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,564
that your brain
literally couldn't hold the memories in?

97
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,317
- This summer...
- Apparently,

98
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,832
I left a phone message
for Nellie last night.

99
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:21,655
I need you to find out what I said.

100
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,719
I am a little busy.

101
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:27,035
'Course.

102
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:32,376
Why don't you list the things
that would keep you from helping me.

103
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:37,206
- I can make you a list.
- Let's do it now.

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,465
What's number one?

105
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:43,468
Why don't I help you now?

106
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,844
There we go.

107
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,052
Who the hell are Jim Halpert
and Dwight Schrute?

108
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,603
Jim, Dwight, your last names?

109
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,480
And you are?

110
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,108
Harry Jannerone,
Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.

111
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,900
What the hell's all this?

112
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,882
Cherries jubilee
over homemade gelato.

113
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:09,558
You live well down here in PA.

114
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:11,871
I want to talk to you guys right now.

115
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,123
And Lloyd Gross too.

116
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,839
Which one's that guy?

117
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,898
The salesmen have a commission cap
but we figured out a way around it.

118
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:21,283
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman
we invented to...

119
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:24,305
How do I put this?
Steal from the company.

120
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,943
Embezzle.
To commit fraud.

121
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:29,089
It sounds sketchy,
but it helps us get more money.

122
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,914
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd.
He is a blend of all the salesmen.

123
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:36,694
There he is.

124
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:39,182
- That's Lloyd.
- Me?

125
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,866
Yeah, you.

126
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:43,904
Where do you get off
crossing State lines?

127
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,123
Now, we're actually closer
to Binghamton than you are.

128
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,249
Kimosabe.

129
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,999
I like to think Lloyd Gross
is a no-nonsense guy

130
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:52,937
who doesn't back down from anybody.

131
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,603
And he calls people "kimosabe."

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,935
They're New York.
We're New York.

133
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,338
State line is the dividing line.
That's the way it's always been.

134
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,214
There's no rule that says that.

135
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,507
That's true.

136
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,885
There's no rule.
You can check the employee handbook.

137
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:08,886
Can I check the employee handbook?

138
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,681
Does it say anything
about choking a man with my bare hands?

139
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:15,756
Wait, no?
Are you kidding me?

140
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:17,309
You told me there was.

141
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,522
I could've choked
so many people by now.

142
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:20,912
Stay out of my State.

143
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,984
It's in your best interest.

144
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:25,028
I've seen guys like you.

145
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:27,405
Big guys who like
to push the little guys around.

146
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:30,325
Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you
for breakfast.

147
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,744
Just stay out of New York.

148
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:37,152
Text from the old wife.
Gonna take that.

149
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,046
Why don't we just ask Robert?

150
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,341
Can we all agree
that the CEO should decide this?

151
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,717
Robert's here?

152
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:49,135
Look at us.

153
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,927
Bickering like schoolgirls,
looking around the room

154
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:53,807
for things to hit each other with.

155
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,579
I don't think we were doing that.

156
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:58,589
Chair, lamp, plant,
table leg, Jim's leg.

157
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,191
Where's the Advil?
I think I've hit my limit

158
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,477
on the Tylenol.

159
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:05,860
Sorry, not Jim.

160
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:07,821
What must we do to get rid of you?

161
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:11,074
Hire you back
and send Erin back to Florida?

162
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:13,884
Message received loud and clear.

163
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,666
Just have to get
the caramelized sugar

164
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,622
- off the pan before it dries.
- For God...

165
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:22,210
What a surprise you're here.

166
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,965
Why would you close Binghamton
without a transition plan?

167
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,260
- How do you mean?
- I forgot a pan...

168
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,641
Stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.

169
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:36,523
There is a time for every decision,

170
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,430
predetermined many years ago.

171
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:43,475
There's no benefit in questioning
why this particular decision seems...

172
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,067
So poorly timed.

173
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:48,905
What are you deciding?
We get a say.

174
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,985
Listen, Robert, I don't have time.
There's a big client in play.

175
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,062
- Prestige Direct Mail Solutions.
- Don't listen.

176
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:56,035
Used to be Binghamton's.
I want it, it's mine.

177
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,581
Prestige is ours. They do
half of the junk mail on the seaboard.

178
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,833
We get them.
We already put a call into them.

179
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,501
We need you to make a decision.

180
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,462
- Make a decision.
- I did.

181
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:09,173
Neither of you
are to have any contact

182
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:14,287
with either Prestige or any
other Binghamton client

183
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:17,369
until I have figured out
how to divide things up.

184
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,392
As Solomon once said...

185
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,989
Some bizarre energy
in this place today.

186
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:28,379
Robert is going off the rails,

187
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:29,961
making some funky decisions.

188
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,902
Why is nobody gonna call on Prestige?

189
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,072
It's a huge client.

190
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:34,918
They could give their business

191
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,615
to the first person at the door.

192
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,198
Could be any idiot.

193
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:39,454
Any idiot at all.

194
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,292
Shaping a company is in a sense

195
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,447
similar to training a geisha.

196
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:51,483
You have to mold
not merely the physical form,

197
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,236
but also the character.

198
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:56,042
The two must harmonize.

199
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:58,808
Are they still there?

200
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:04,019
They want a decision
on who gets the big client.

201
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,898
They can wait.

202
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,910
I'll still be talking about geishas

203
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,848
long past their bedtime.

204
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:13,821
You know, I trained as one.

205
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,039
Is it just me
or is our boss a freakin' weirdo?

206
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,369
I'm gonna get some air.

207
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:31,359
You know
what would be really dastardly?

208
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:34,634
If we snuck out of here
and got to the client first.

209
00:10:45,113 --> 00:10:46,062
He's running!

210
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:49,399
Damn it!

211
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,526
Damn it.

212
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,014
- What is this supposed to be?
- It's a monkey.

213
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:57,063
Get real.

214
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:00,155
This is not a monkey.
It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose.

215
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,632
Hold on.
Is this him?

216
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,407
- What?
- Is that him?

217
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:07,041
- It's him! Do something!
- What am I gonna do?

218
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,335
Go slash his tires!
Go dent his hood.

219
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:13,548
That's it?
Great.

220
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,631
That's like a five-second delay.

221
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:17,260
Go!

222
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:19,596
Does this thing have turbo?
Nitrous?

223
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,321
- Hit the Nos.
- Nos?

224
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:24,352
Like in <i>Fast And Furious?</i>
Yeah, definitely.

225
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,391
- Hit the Nos.
- Are you sure?

226
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:29,035
- Brace yourself. 3... 2... 1.
- We got it. Go!

227
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,210
Here we go!

228
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:38,531
Hello.
Andy Bernard to see the CEO.

229
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,117
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, I do not.

230
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:42,827
I can squeeze you in.

231
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:45,204
Seriously?

232
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:48,521
'Cause I could just be anyone.

233
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:50,460
I thought I was gonna have
to convince you.

234
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:53,671
- He's really not that busy.
- Is there someone here to see me?

235
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,048
Yes, this man.

236
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,264
Come on in.

237
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,932
So... What do you make
of this Robert California guy?

238
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,144
What does a guy like that do
on an average weeknight?

239
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,396
I'll tell you what he does.

240
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:13,037
Hello!
Hello, my clucking hens.

241
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:15,900
Got room for another in the roost?

242
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:17,487
Don't worry, I won't lay an egg.

243
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,916
Robert sent me to take over
if Pam fails.

244
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,042
If?

245
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,311
I have been crunching numbers
all day.

246
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:29,925
Math is for boys.

247
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,899
I need girl talk.

248
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:35,546
Did someone say girl talk?

249
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,555
Sometimes I wonder
if I have ovaries in my scrotum,

250
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,137
because I am great at girl talk.

251
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:46,065
Have you guys been watching
any good Korean soap operas?

252
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,250
I'm pretty deep into
<i>Hee-Jungcinderella Girl.</i>

253
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,646
Although, I definitely fast-forward
ugh the young-Tae storylines.

254
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,607
Do you think I'd like that,
or do I have to have an Asian fetish?

255
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:57,859
I think you're gonna need
to have an Asian fetish.

256
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:01,155
It'll be upsetting if you don't.

257
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:02,721
I'm a former paper executive.

258
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:04,421
I know the product and the margins.

259
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:07,412
I can save you 25% on your costs.

260
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,997
Why haven't I heard of you?
You got any references?

261
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm a rogue.

262
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,876
Which is the best part.

263
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,304
That means you will be
my first customer

264
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,761
and your business
will get 100% of my attention.

265
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,344
I have written down
my personal phone number.

266
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:27,682
You call this anytime.

267
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:31,519
Every salesman I've met has given me
his personal phone number.

268
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:33,638
Of course they have.

269
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:37,984
Which is why I'm giving you
a key to my house.

270
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,809
Whatever you need.
Anytime, night or day.

271
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,284
You just stop on by.

272
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,163
You want me to drive
to your house if I need paper.

273
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,375
Maybe you want someone to talk to
or a place to crash for a couple of days

274
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:57,470
My wireless password
is "eat, pray, love."

275
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:58,793
Easy to remember.

276
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,205
Ready?
Go, go!

277
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:23,941
You all right?

278
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:40,506
Dwight, what are you doing?

279
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,541
Go, go!
Take the stairs! Now!

280
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,280
I don't even know where their are.

281
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,182
- I'll stall him. Go!
- God!

282
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,140
What are you doing?

283
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:58,847
I'm gonna activate
the seismic failsafe.

284
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:01,522
We'll be stuck between floors
for hours.

285
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:09,943
- My pants fell down.
- What?

286
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,807
My pants fell down!
I don't have a belt!

287
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:15,722
Hello, sir.

288
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:18,626
Dwight K Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Forgive my pants, they fell down.

289
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,878
An appointment with Mr. Ramish.
Right now is fine.

290
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:23,631
I was here first. Dwight K Schrute.
Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.

291
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,841
What's going on?

292
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:29,136
Harry Jannerone.
Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse.

293
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:31,341
I already made an appointment
with your secretary.

294
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,559
Let me stop you all. I've already picked
a new paper supplier.

295
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:36,227
It's not DM Utica, is it?

296
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,648
No, no, it's not
Dunder Mifflin at all actually.

297
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:42,342
- It's... Big Red Paper Company.
- Big Red Paper Company?

298
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,082
- Give me a cup of coffee.
- Me too.

299
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,043
Or do you also
have a monopoly on thirst?

300
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,089
All right.
It didn't work out for any of us.

301
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:59,750
So... We're still on the same team.
Let me get these.

302
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,255
Let him get his own.
He's got Syracuse money.

303
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,340
You know, your partner's got
a lotta attitude.

304
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:09,260
But I like that.
How long you guys been dating?

305
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,315
Jim couldn't land me
in a thousand years.

306
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,723
- But you're saying there's a chance.
- Shut up.

307
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:21,814
I stole Nellie's phone.

308
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:24,649
Excellent. Excellent.

309
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:28,770
Though troubling that your
first instinct is thievery.

310
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:32,116
- What do you want from me?
- Now we get to the bottom of Nellie's

311
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,985
"yes, yes, yes, yes. Never."

312
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:37,070
<i>Hello, Nell, it's mom.
You'll keep your chin up.</i>

313
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:39,265
<i>It can't possibly be as bad
as you described.</i>

314
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,625
Oh, yes, it can.

315
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:45,940
<i>This is MasterCard.
You are over the limit.</i>

316
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:48,933
<i>Send the minimum payment
of $448 by Monday</i>

317
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,265
<i>or we will be forced
to send it to collections.</i>

318
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,345
Shopaholic.

319
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:53,846
Sounds like it.

320
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:57,941
<i>Hi, sis. Is your boss
still hitting on you?</i>

321
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,779
<i>This is Annie from Second Nests.</i>

322
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,752
<i>I'm sorry but the Romanian
orphanage felt more comfortable</i>

323
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:09,602
<i>with a two-person nuclear family
than a single mother.</i>

324
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,489
- <i>We're gonna hold out for that.</i>
- Stop.

325
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,241
We need to get to the bottom of this.
Come on.

326
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,621
Okay, oops! I deleted them all.
They're all deleted.

327
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,457
Pam, Pam.
You've completely bungled this!

328
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:32,202
Can I do it, Pam?

329
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:35,471
Can I pull off a gold Arabian sandal?

330
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:38,326
Yes. Definitely.

331
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,465
With your hair.

332
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,759
Certainly.

333
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:43,569
- You dropped your cell phone.
- Oh! Gosh.

334
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,440
Thank you.
I'm so stupid.

335
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,149
No. My goodness.
You have a lot going on.

336
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:50,569
With Robert and everything.

337
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,197
Oh, God, Pam.
Don't get me started.

338
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,700
- No, I will not.
- You've just got me started.

339
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,272
Robert...

340
00:17:57,397 --> 00:17:58,244
is...

341
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,287
a filthy beast.

342
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,918
I mean, don't you get the feeling,
every time he looks at you,

343
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,586
he's just thinking
of 15 different ways to do you?

344
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:11,716
I mean, the man talks
of nothing but sex.

345
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,810
But sometimes he talks about flesh...

346
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:15,944
and bacchanals.

347
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:19,974
I cannot even tell you what
he left on my phone last night.

348
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,269
No... Don't.
Just put it out of your mind.

349
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:28,859
Pam, what is your address?

350
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,401
I'm gonna send you a pair
of these gold harem shoes.

351
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,697
- No. You don't...
- Oh, yes.

352
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,825
Come on, a little
gold Arabian slipper.

353
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,934
Things are looking up.

354
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,876
I might be a mother soon.

355
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,876
I have MasterCard
right where I want them.

356
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:48,624
And...

357
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,324
I have a new friend.

358
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:53,728
A friend.

359
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:56,475
At work.

360
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:03,103
There's a call for you on line one.

361
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:04,928
Who is it?

362
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:07,464
He says Salvation.
No last name.

363
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,220
You once put me on a list
of the losers in the office.

364
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:18,233
Well, this loser just got
your biggest client

365
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,867
to give him all their business.

366
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,453
<i>So hire me back,
that business is yours.</i>

367
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,081
Don't, and I will find another buyer.

368
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:26,749
You're blackmailing me.

369
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,283
It's just business.

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,001
Ah, well.

371
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:33,627
I will not be blackmailed by
some ineffectual, privileged,

372
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,800
effete, soft-penised debutante.

373
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,217
<i>You wanna start a street fight with me,
bring it on.</i>

374
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:40,054
<i>You'll be surprised
by how ugly it gets.</i>

375
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:42,325
You don't even know my real name.

376
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,266
I'm the fucking Lizard King.

377
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,697
Well, I gave him a chance.

378
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:07,748
- Andy Bernard.
- You got a minute?

379
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,501
I'm in the middle of a piano lesson.

380
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,886
I wanted to see if I could
interest you in an investment.

381
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:15,464
Dunder Mifflin.

382
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,903
Dunder Mifflin.

383
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:21,762
Now... Why would I want that?
It's worth half what it was 3 years ago.

384
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:22,979
Exactly.

385
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:25,780
And you know
that with the right management,

386
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:29,270
it could be worth twice
what you would pay for it today.

387
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:34,942
Why don't you come in?

388
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:45,536
So what would you do
if you weren't selling paper?

389
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,288
Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets.

390
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,098
- Probably submit them for competitions.
- What?

391
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,460
It sounds stupid, but nationals has
always kinda been a dream of mine.

392
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:55,462
How have we never talked
about this before?

393
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:57,631
Wait.

394
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:59,717
You don't even care about nationals.

395
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,763
Nothing?

396
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,681
I've always wanted
to own a bike shop, but...

397
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,958
What about you?

398
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:10,767
I'd like to sell one
big thing, you know?

399
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:12,646
Like... a plane.

400
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,829
One sale, I'm out.

401
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,443
That sounds lovely.

402
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,222
Anyway, Robert is gonna run this
company to the ground...

403
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:21,447
So...

404
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,825
We won't be doing this in six months.
